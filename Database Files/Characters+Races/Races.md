Races Overview (3 - 10)

    Besides humans, there are four different races that inhabit Phalmasia: Terrians, Argens, Avats, and Majuu. Each of them primarily inhabit one continent of Phalmasia, and have different ways of life, as well as unique characteristics and magic options. It is possible for some of these races to learn magic that isn't in their common subset, but it is very uncommon. Humans, unfortunately, cannot learn magic.

Terrians (14 - 24)

    Terrians
    
    Race Ability: Increased stamina. 
    
    Common Magic Affinities: Fire, Water, Earth, Lightning, Wind, Ice
    Native Continent: Halgeis
    
    A peaceful race that highly populates the Halgeis Region. Many terrians work as farmers, and have a long standing relationship with other races. They can be found living almost everywhere and can easily adapt to new environments. They originally built the city of Grand Elise as a way to bring all races together to live in harmony and peace, and established the Divina Royal Family that ruled for many generations.
    
    It is said that the terrians evolved from their domesticated ancestors during the old age of the world's birth, taking on forms to better serve the one place they call home. Terrians are very diverse and come in all shapes and sizes.

Argens (28 - 38)

    Argens
    
    Race Ability: Magic Proficiency & Scales slightly resist Magic-Based Attacks
    
    Common Magic Affinities: Fire, Lightning, Earth, Ice
    Native Continent: Mu'karr
    
    A highly intelligent and curious race, argens populate the mountainous, forest-covered region of Mu'karr. Very in tune with nature and mana, they are people who have a strong thirst for knowledge, many becoming researchers or professors in school. Their lifestyle is simple and homely, many preferring to stay in Mu'karr as the climate fits perfectly for their preferred environment high in the mountains.
    
    Argens were the first of the new races to appear after terrians, when humans discovered and explored Mu'karr. They come in a variety of colors and patterns. They are also the only race capable of having an affinity for gravity magic.

Avats (42 - 50)

    Avats
    
    Race Ability: Magic Proficiency & Increased speed
    
    Common Magic Affinities: Wind, Lightning, Ice, Water
    Native Continent: Altaria
    
    Another intelligent race, avats are theorists, and have just as much as a thirst for knowledge as argens do. They are highly respected philosophers. Along with other researchers, avats study the mysterious history of the world and the development and knowledge behind how magic is used, taking a careful look into each element. They've written many books on the subject, and are highly skilled in the use of magic due to their extensive knowledge.

Majuu (54 - 64)

    Majuu
    
    Race Ability: Increased resistance to physical attacks
    
    Common Magic Affinities: Earth, Fire
    Native Continent: Xhia
    
    A race of large goat/bull like beasts that grow to a maximum of 9 to 10 feet tall, and originate from Xhia. Because of the Arduos War, the majuu people were divided amongst themselves, some living in a higher society away from the others who live on the outskirts. The war they started ran their friendly and kind reputation into the ground. Though most majuu are gentle giants, some are hostile due to their trust issues. Some even move to Halgeis in hopes of giving a better life for their families, though the prejudice proves to make that difficult.
    
    The color of a majuu's fur is dependent on their climate. Bright-colored majuu are from warmer areas, while darker colored majuu are from colder areas. They are also known to be very skilled blacksmiths, and have created many fearsome weapons and tools in the past. Majuu are the longest living species on Phalmasia, averaging a lifespan of 200 years.
