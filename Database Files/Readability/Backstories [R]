Xaeyz Backstory

    Chapter 1: The Day of Black Sun

    Xaeyz was born with wind magic, an oddity for Argens. As a result, no one could teach him, and was made fun of often.
     He did not let this stop him, however, and dropped out of school to train himself at age five. During his training,
     Xaeyz met another young argen named Mirago, who also dropped out of school due to a hatred of magic. Xaeyz helps
     Mirago overcome this hatred, and they train together for the next two years, dreaming of applying to St. Guardia's
     and becoming guardians.

    In 4030, a great black meteor that the world came to know as the Black Sun, came crashing down on Meteora. Mirago,
     being the Onyx Fire User, helps Xaeyz to try to slow it down, though the many strong magic users of the village
     could not. Their power is not enough to stop the catastrophe. Suddenly, Xaeyz gains a new power, the affinity for
     Cosmic Wind, and with this power and Mirago's Onyx Fire, the meteor was stopped.

    However, when fighting this interstellar threat, they discovered something incredible: the meteor was absorbing
     their magic. No other metal or rock on Phalmasia had the ability, so it was certainly unique. Unfortunately, this
     victory and information came with a great cost. Mirago had nearly exhausted his mana trying to stop the meteor,
     and collapsed. Mirago understood the power this meteor had, and realized what could happen if it fell into the
     wrong hands.

    Using what was left of his mana, he used Xaeyz's new wind and his own to build a Divine Spell; one that would seal
     out any magic but the ones that made up the seal. Though it would be weak, it would be enough to protect the meteor
     from those that would abuse its power. Mirago and Xaeyz were the only ones who knew about the properties of the
     meteor, so to keep the power safe, they mutually decided to keep the secret safe. This promise ended up being
     Mirago's final words.

    However, this was not the end of Xaeyz's problems. A lightning bolt hit Xaeyz in the back, and a fireball in the side.
     The villagers of Meteora were attacking him. They were scared of him. Who wouldn't be, after a seven-year-old boy
     stopped a threat the entire village's best couldn't stand a chance against? But Xaeyz didn't understand. He and
     Mirago had saved the lives of everyone. Why were they attacking him?

    He used his magic to defend himself and Mirago's body, but he was fighting an losing battle. He refused to fight back.
     He couldn't hurt his fellow argens; his family. So he merely defended. He couldn't last forever, though, and soon
     he was overwhelmed by the force of the townspeople. Then someone (something?) whispered to him. It told him not to
     fight the villagers. That he needed to get away to the place where he met Mirago. And so Xaeyz grabbed Mirago and
     took off into Duskfaze Forest.

    Xaeyz didn't know why he was listening to this ominous voice. But he does know who was talking to him: the cosmic wind.
     Whatever this new power was, it was sentient. But he trusted it, and he had to keep going to the place he met his
     best friend: *Aurora Grotto*. It was his and Mirago's favorite place. Xaeyz knew that Mirago had a favorite tree in
     the grotto; it was the biggest one in the field, at the very center of an island in a small lake. Under this flowering
     tree, Xaeyz gave Mirago his final resting place.

    Chapter 2: The Aurora Scythe

    Xaeyz spent the next few days mourning his friend's loss, but knew he still had more work to do: he had to seal
     the meteor's powers away as soon as possible. He couldn't do it himself; the only way to condense the meteor into
     a smaller object without cutting any of it off was with earth magic, and a lot of experience with weapon forging.
     Xaeyz knew someone who could do the job in Meteora: his grandfather, the town's blacksmith.

    The next day, Xaeyz sneaked back into Meteora to see his grandfather, Armedies. When he found him in his workshop,
     he explained everything about what really happened and what needed to be done. Xaeyz apologized after he was done
     for coming in the first place, and started to leave in case his grandfather was scared of him like the rest of the
     town. Armedies, however, stops him and says he's willing to help him.

    Armedies also mentions that the village was oblivious to the help, and power, of Mirago. This was a great relief
     to Xaeyz because he figured that if there was a spell to render magic useless on an object, then there might be
     one to steal magic from others, too. If anyone would be able to steal Mirago's powerful magic, it wouldn't be
     good. Xaeyz decided to keep Mirago and the existence of *Aurora Grotto* secret to anyone else.

    Getting the meteor was the easy part: Armedies was supposed to remove it that day so he could use it for a fuel
     source in his shop. Now, Xaeyz explained his designs for the meteor: a staff. Xaeyz wanted to turn the whole
     meteor into a staff that had built-in wings so he wouldn't need a glider. He also wanted to add a storage
     compartment somewhere that would require an input of magic to open.

    His grandfather condensed the entirety of the meteor into a staff, which ended up, for some reason, to be no
     heavier than an ordinary wooden one. He added the wings and a storage compartment to the staff. Once it was
     finished, Xaeyz needed to add the most important part. He took out the Divine Rune and cast the spell on the staff.
     But something unexpected happened. The spell summoned a blinding light that engulfed the workshop, and alerted
     everyone outside.

    Knowing people would come inside to check if everything is alright, his grandfather told him to go back to his
     house and talk to his parents one last time before running off. Xaeyz grabbed his new staff, now branded with
     the Divine Mark of the Phoenix (the symbol created when the divine spell was cast with fire and wind magic), and
     ran to his old home. When he got there, his parents were waiting for him.

    They embraced him, explaining that they were not afraid, and gave him some money, a black cloak with a hood, and a
     goodbye. Xaeyz blasted off back into the forest where he lived in *Aurora Grotto* for another week, surviving off
     of the fruit trees surrounding the grotto. It was rough and scary for him since he had never lived on his own
     before. Why would he; he was only seven after all. But much worse was to come; another tragedy.

    The next week, Xaeyz heard yelling coming from the direction of Meteora, so he hopped into the trees and went to
     check it out. What he found horrified him. His mom, dad, and grandfather were on the ground in a field, beaten,
     shocked, and burned. They were shouting at them, asking where Xaeyz had gone. They did not say a word. They
     weren't going to give up family to an angry mob. For this secrecy, the townspeople gathered their magic and
     killed all three while Xaeyz watched.

    Xaeyz eyes widened. Tears streamed down his face as he looked at the burned corpses of his family. And he lost
     control. He crashed down into the field with cosmic wind rushing out of him. His eyes were aglow with this power,
     and the sight brought fear to the townspeople. Xaeyz screamed in anger at his former friends. Thoughts raced
     through his head, and all he could do was scream. His magic was more relentless and powerful than it had ever
     been, and it sent everyone flying backwards.

    Xaeyz finally came to his senses and the cosmic wind died down. He looked back at the people of his former home
     cower and beg for forgiveness. All Xaeyz did was whisper an apology and rush away before he could get so much as
     a response. He ran farther than he ever had before, miles and miles farther away from Meteora than he had ever
     been. He kept going until he had gotten somewhere new: the Enchanted Forest of Grand Elise, the center of Halgeis.

    Chapter 3 (109 - 133)
    Chapter 3: The Forest's Shadow

    Here Xaeyz found a home in a tree he called the Heaven Tree. A wolf, sheep and crow had been living together in
     the tree before he had arrived, and he befriended them. In remembrance of his best friend, he named the wolf
     Mirago, and trained here for the remainder of our story. Xaeyz was going to train hard to become a guardian. He
     had a mission to carry on his friend's dream; and to make sure no one hurt the way he did.

    Two years afterward, a fire was burning in the Tree of Souls at the very center of the forest. Xaeyz had grown very
     used to living in the wild and loved the forest, so he had to do something about it. Wind magic was notorious
     against fire, however. Water or earth users were most effective wih dealing with natural flames since wind usually
     just spread them. But now was Xaeyz's time to show off the results of his two years of training, and rushed to the
     tree.

    Putting up his hood, jumping above the trees with a magic gust and grabbing his Aurora Staff from his back, Xaeyz
     launched himself high above the tree. Xaeyz then spun his staff rapidly and launched magic out of it. The result
     was his first wind spell: Gale Vacuum. This spell, unlike other wind spells, created an absense of air in its
     radius; a makeshift vacuum. Since fire relies and feeds on air, the flames went out quickly after being engulfed by
     the attack. Xaeyz had gotten stronger.

    Xaeyz had been keeping tabs on a town nearby the Enchanted Forest called Drəklife since he had arrived. There, he
     learned of the name the argens from Meteora began to call him: 'The Boy of Cosmic Wind'. He preferred the Cosmic
     Wind User; a boy sounded less cool to him. He was also known as 'The Forest's Shadow' since he had stopped the
     forest fire. However, two years after the fire, Xaeyz encountered his final challenge: a fire user attacking the town.

    Chapter 4: Hozura the Flame

    The Avat attacking was known as Hozura the Flame, a man who was being hunted by the guardians for about 3 weeks.
     He wasn't particularly strong, but was extremely smart and always attacked places without guardians and places
     that were far away from them. Xaeyz put on his cloak and jumped into the town to protect the townspeople and try
     to stop Hozura. Hozura had gathered all the townspeople together and had a magic attack poised at them. He fired
     when they didn't give him access to the bank.

    Xaeyz landed in front of them and used his own wind magic to stop the flames from hurting anyone. This upset Hozura,
    and he drew his sword, threatening to kill him if he kept getting in his way. The townspeople began to murmur
    behind him about being in the presence of the Forest's Shadow as Xaeyz took out his staff. The battle began. Hozura
    and Xaeyz clashed with their weapons for several minutes, and Xaeyz was on par with him despite being much younger
    than him.

    Xaeyz asked him during their fight why Hozura was doing this, and he responded by throwing a fireball at his head.
     Xaeyz promptly dodged and swung with his staff, landing a clean blow. Xaeyz gathered magic in his lungs and blew 
     a blast of air at Hozura, pushing him backwards. However, Hozura had a plan of his own. He had concentrated magic 
     beneath Xaeyz and began to trigger it. Xaeyz noticed and hopped out of the way just before the ground below him 
     exploded.

    Hozura used an explosion beneath himself to get up to Xaeyz and swung his sword, throwing three fireballs along the
     arc of his swing. Xaeyz channelled mana into his staff and knocked them both away, all the while keeping damage 
     to Drəklife as minimal as he could. Xaeyz threw slashes of wind at Hozura while parrying fireballs and explosions 
     from Hozura. After a while of fighting him, he knew that this couldn't continue.

    Xaeyz needed to leave before the guardians got here, which means he needed to defeat Hozura before he left. Xaeyz
     needed to trap him, and Xaeyz had just the thing to do it. Xaeyz opened up the bottom of his glider on the staff 
     and swung, releasing a wave of intense wind at Hozura, which he couldn't counter and sent him flying backwards. 
     Xaeyz then inhaled and blew another gust at him, pinning him to the ground. Finally, he poised for his final blow.

    Xaeyz channelled as much mana as he could spare into his staff and let loose with a blast of air from his staff.
     The amount of air that Hozura was dealing with caused so much pressure, the ground beneath him began to crack and 
     he passed out. As Xaeyz slowly floated to the ground, he knew that he had won. Xaeyz checked the town: barely any 
     damage besides the cracks in the ground and a few buildings that were scorched. Not bad for his first actual battle.

    Xaeyz rushed back to the towns people to make sure they were ok. When he told them that Hozura had been knocked
     out, they celebrated. Xaeyz had Hozura cuffed and restrained so he couldn't move until the guardians got here. 
     Xaeyz had also gained Hozura's bounty. In order to claim it, he had to stay afterwards and show his face to the 
     guardians, which were two things he couldn't do. So he gave a note to the mayor that gave the bounty back to the 
     town for repairs as a gift before leaving Drəklife once again.

    Xaeyz had defeated his first villain at age 11. For the next three years, Xaeyz trained as hard as he could.

    After those three years, he took the entry exam to St. Guardia's, and at age 14, he passed, and the rest is history...
