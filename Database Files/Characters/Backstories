Xaeyz Backstory (4 - 85)

    Chapter 1 (4 - 21)
    Chapter 1: The Day of Black Sun

    Xaeyz was born with wind magic, an oddity for Argens. As a result, no one could teach him, and was made fun of often. He did not let this stop him, however, and dropped out of school to train himself at age five. During his training,Xaeyz met another young argen named Mirago, who also dropped out of school due to a hatred of magic. Xaeyz helps Mirago overcome this hatred, and they train together for the next two years, dreaming of applying to St. Guardia's and becoming guardians.

    In 4030, a great black meteor that the world came to know as the Black Sun, came crashing down on Meteora. Mirago, being the Onyx Fire User, helps Xaeyz to try to slow it down, though the many strong magic users of the village could not. Their power is not enough to stop the catastrophe. Suddenly, Xaeyz gains a new power, the affinity for Cosmic Wind, and with this power and Mirago's Onyx Fire, the meteor was stopped.

    However, when fighting this interstellar threat, they discovered something incredible: the meteor was absorbing their magic. No other metal or rock on Phalmasia had the ability, so it was certainly unique. Unfortunately, this victory and information came with a great cost. Mirago had nearly exhausted his mana trying to stop the meteor, and collapsed. Mirago understood the power this meteor had, and realized what could happen if it fell into the wrong hands.

    Using what was left of his mana, he used Xaeyz's new wind and his own to build a Divine Spell; one that would seal out any magic but the ones that made up the seal. Though it would be weak, it would be enough to protect the meteor from those that would abuse its power. Mirago and Xaeyz were the only ones who knew about the properties of the meteor, so to keep the power safe, they mutually decided to keep the secret safe. This promise ended up being Mirago's final words.

    However, this was not the end of Xaeyz's problems. A lightning bolt hit Xaeyz in the back, and a fireball in the side. The villagers of Meteora were attacking him. They were scared of him. Who wouldn't be, after a seven-year-old boy stopped a threat the entire village's best couldn't stand a chance against? But Xaeyz didn't understand. He and Mirago had saved the lives of everyone. Why were they attacking him?

    He used his magic to defend himself and Mirago's body, but he was fighting an losing battle. He refused to fight back. He couldn't hurt his fellow argens; his family. So he merely defended. He couldn't last forever, though, and soon he was overwhelmed by the force of the townspeople. Then someone (something?) whispered to him. It told him not to fight the villagers. That he needed to get away to the place where he met Mirago. And so Xaeyz grabbed Mirago and took off into Duskfaze Forest.

    Xaeyz didn't know why he was listening to this ominous voice. But he does know who was talking to him: the cosmic wind. Whatever this new power was, it was sentient. But he trusted it, and he had to keep going to the place he met his best friend: *Aurora Grotto*. It was his and Mirago's favorite place. Xaeyz knew that Mirago had a favorite tree in the grotto; it was the biggest one in the field, at the very center of an island in a small lake. Under this flowering tree, Xaeyz gave Mirago his final resting place.

    Chapter 2 (24 - 47)
    Chapter 2: The Aurora Scythe

    Xaeyz spent the next few days mourning his friend's loss, but knew he still had more work to do: he had to seal the meteor's powers away as soon as possible. He couldn't do it himself; the only way to condense the meteor into a smaller object without cutting any of it off was with earth magic, and a lot of experience with weapon forging. Xaeyz knew someone who could do the job in Meteora: his grandfather, the town's blacksmith.

    The next day, Xaeyz sneaked back into Meteora to see his grandfather, Armedies. When he found him in his workshop, he explained everything about what really happened and what needed to be done. Xaeyz apologized after he was done for coming in the first place, and started to leave in case his grandfather was scared of him like the rest of the town. Armedies, however, stops him and says he's willing to help him.

    Armedies also mentions that the village was oblivious to the help, and power, of Mirago. This was a great relief to Xaeyz because he figured that if there was a spell to render magic useless on an object, then there might be one to steal magic from others, too. If anyone would be able to steal Mirago's powerful magic, it wouldn't be good. Xaeyz decided to keep Mirago and the existence of *Aurora Grotto* secret to anyone else.

    Getting the meteor was the easy part: Armedies was supposed to remove it that day so he could use it for a fuel source in his shop. Now, Xaeyz explained his designs for the meteor: a staff. Xaeyz wanted to turn the whole meteor into a staff that had built-in wings so he wouldn't need a glider. He also wanted to add a storage compartment somewhere that would require an input of magic to open.

    His grandfather condensed the entirety of the meteor into a staff, which ended up, for some reason, to be no heavier than an ordinary wooden one. He added the wings and a storage compartment to the staff. Once it was finished, Xaeyz needed to add the most important part. He took out the Divine Rune and cast the spell on the staff. But something unexpected happened. The spell summoned a blinding light that engulfed the workshop, and alerted everyone outside.

    Knowing people would come inside to check if everything is alright, his grandfather told him to go back to his house and talk to his parents one last time before running off. Xaeyz grabbed his new staff, now branded with the Divine Mark of the Phoenix (the symbol created when the divine spell was cast with fire and wind magic), and ran to his old home. When he got there, his parents were waiting for him.

    They embraced him, explaining that they were not afraid, and gave him some money, a black cloak with a hood, and a goodbye. Xaeyz blasted off back into the forest where he lived in *Aurora Grotto* for another week, surviving off of the fruit trees surrounding the grotto. It was rough and scary for him since he had never lived on his own before. Why would he; he was only seven after all. But much worse was to come; another tragedy.

    The next week, Xaeyz heard yelling coming from the direction of Meteora, so he hopped into the trees and went to check it out. What he found horrified him. His mom, dad, and grandfather were on the ground in a field, beaten, shocked, and burned. They were shouting at them, asking where Xaeyz had gone. They did not say a word. They weren't going to give up family to an angry mob. For this secrecy, the townspeople gathered their magic and killed all three while Xaeyz watched.

    Xaeyz eyes widened. Tears streamed down his face as he looked at the burned corpses of his family. And he lost control. He crashed down into the field with cosmic wind rushing out of him. His eyes were aglow with this power, and the sight brought fear to the townspeople. Xaeyz screamed in anger at his former friends. Thoughts raced through his head, and all he could do was scream. His magic was more relentless and powerful than it had ever been, and it sent everyone flying backwards.

    Xaeyz finally came to his senses and the cosmic wind died down. He looked back at the people of his former home cower and beg for forgiveness. All Xaeyz did was whisper an apology and rush away before he could get so much as a response. He ran farther than he ever had before, miles and miles farther away from Meteora than he had ever been. He kept going until he had gotten somewhere new: the Enchanted Forest of Grand Elise, the center of Halgeis.

    Chapter 3 (50 - 61)
    Chapter 3: The Forest's Shadow

    Here Xaeyz found a home in a tree he called the Heaven Tree. A wolf, sheep and crow had been living together in the tree before he had arrived, and he befriended them. In remembrance of his best friend, he named the wolf Mirago, and trained here for the remainder of our story. Xaeyz was going to train hard to become a guardian. He had a mission to carry on his friend's dream; and to make sure no one hurt the way he did.

    Two years afterward, a fire was burning in the Tree of Souls at the very center of the forest. Xaeyz had grown very used to living in the wild and loved the forest, so he had to do something about it. Wind magic was notorious against fire, however. Water or earth users were most effective wih dealing with natural flames since wind usually just spread them. But now was Xaeyz's time to show off the results of his two years of training, and rushed to the tree.

    Putting up his hood, jumping above the trees with a magic gust and grabbing his Aurora Staff from his back, Xaeyz launched himself high above the tree. Xaeyz then spun his staff rapidly and launched magic out of it. The result was his first wind spell: Gale Vacuum. This spell, unlike other wind spells, created an absense of air in its radius; a makeshift vacuum. Since fire relies and feeds on air, the flames went out quickly after being engulfed by the attack. Xaeyz had gotten stronger.

    Xaeyz had been keeping tabs on a town nearby the Enchanted Forest called Dr…ôklife since he had arrived. There, he learned of the name the argens from Meteora began to call him: 'The Boy of Cosmic Wind'. He preferred the Cosmic Wind User; a boy sounded less cool to him. He was also known as 'The Forest's Shadow' since he had stopped the forest fire. However, two years after the fire, Xaeyz encountered his final challenge: a fire user attacking the town.

    Chapter 4 (64 - 85)
    Chapter 4: Hozura the Flame

    The Avat attacking was known as Hozura the Flame, a man who was being hunted by the guardians for about 3 weeks. He wasn't particularly strong, but was extremely smart and always attacked places without guardians and places that were far away from them. Xaeyz put on his cloak and jumped into the town to protect the townspeople and try to stop Hozura. Hozura had gathered all the townspeople together and had a magic attack poised at them. He fired when they didn't give him access to the bank.

    Xaeyz landed in front of them and used his own wind magic to stop the flames from hurting anyone. This upset Hozura, and he drew his sword, threatening to kill him if he kept getting in his way. The townspeople began to murmur behind him about being in the presence of the Forest's Shadow as Xaeyz took out his staff. The battle began. Hozura and Xaeyz clashed with their weapons for several minutes, and Xaeyz was on par with him despite being much younger than him.

    Xaeyz asked him during their fight why Hozura was doing this, and he responded by throwing a fireball at his head. Xaeyz promptly dodged and swung with his staff, landing a clean blow. Xaeyz gathered magic in his lungs and blew a blast of air at Hozura, pushing him backwards. However, Hozura had a plan of his own. He had concentrated magic beneath Xaeyz and began to trigger it. Xaeyz noticed and hopped out of the way just before the ground below him exploded.

    Hozura used an explosion beneath himself to get up to Xaeyz and swung his sword, throwing three fireballs along the arc of his swing. Xaeyz channelled mana into his staff and knocked them both away, all the while keeping damage to Dr…ôklife as minimal as he could. Xaeyz threw slashes of wind at Hozura while parrying fireballs and explosions from Hozura. After a while of fighting him, he knew that this couldn't continue.

    Xaeyz needed to leave before the guardians got here, which means he needed to defeat Hozura before he left. Xaeyz needed to trap him, and Xaeyz had just the thing to do it. Xaeyz opened up the bottom of his glider on the staff and swung, releasing a wave of intense wind at Hozura, which he couldn't counter and sent him flying backwards. Xaeyz then inhaled and blew another gust at him, pinning him to the ground. Finally, he poised for his final blow.

    Xaeyz channelled as much mana as he could spare into his staff and let loose with a blast of air from his staff. The amount of air that Hozura was dealing with caused so much pressure, the ground beneath him began to crack and he passed out. As Xaeyz slowly floated to the ground, he knew that he had won. Xaeyz checked the town: barely any damage besides the cracks in the ground and a few buildings that were scorched. Not bad for his first actual battle.

    Xaeyz rushed back to the towns people to make sure they were ok. When he told them that Hozura had been knocked out, they celebrated. Xaeyz had Hozura cuffed and restrained so he couldn't move until the guardians got here. Xaeyz had also gained Hozura's bounty. In order to claim it, he had to stay afterwards and show his face to the guardians, which were two things he couldn't do. So he gave a note to the mayor that gave the bounty back to the town for repairs as a gift before leaving Dr…ôklife once again.

    Xaeyz had defeated his first villain at age 11. For the next three years, Xaeyz trained as hard as he could.

    After those three years, he took the entry exam to St. Guardia's, and at age 14, he passed, and the rest is history...

Mirago Backstory (90 - 155)

    Chapter 1 (90 - 105)
    Chapter 1: Onyx Fire

    Mirago loved magic. His dad was a fire user, and though not a guardian, still did his best to protect those in Meteora. He never knew his mom; she died shortly after his sister was born. Mirago looked up to him and awaited the day that he could get his own magic, and he finally got it on his fifth birthday. However, something was strange about his magic when he first used it; instead of being reddish-orange, they were a deep black. He thought that this was incredible and showed his sister, Lea. She was amazed, too, and she frequently went to Duskfaze Forest to watch him practice.

    However, these happy times didn't last. One day, Mirago wanted to try out a spell more advanced than he was ready for. Since his fire was black, he figured that meant he could do it anyway and tried it out. It didn't go as he expected it to. He wanted to make a flamethrower spell like his dad used. Instead, the fire burst out with a heavy force in every direction, searing trees around him and evaporating water in the creek nearby. Mirago was disoriented a bit, but otherwise unharmed. The same couldn't be said for Lea.

    Immediately, Mirago went to go and comfort her. She had a burn on her right arm and was crying. She was alright and understood that this was a mistake, but Mirago was still crying and apologizing over and over. He lifted her up (despite her being close to his own weight) and carried her back to their house. Once Mirago's father saw them approaching, he raced towards them and hurried them inside. He put a soothing remedy over Lea's arm and took her to the village doctor. Mirago didn't decide to come.

    Mirago sat at home for the two days that his dad and sister were gone and had a long talk to himself. He had hurt someone he cared about because of his magic. His father had lost trust in him because o his magic. These black flames weren't a blessing, they were a curse. That day, only two weeks after receiving his gift, decided solemnly to never bring the flames out again. His father and sister returned home later that day. His sister was fine, and his father understood that he was only practicing his magic, but told him to be more careful in the future. He was sure he would be careful; he wouldn't be using his magic anymore.

    Mirago fell into a depression for a while after that. He was scared and angry with himself and this strange power that had cursed him. His father noticed he rarely ever left the house since the incident, and more concerning, hadn't seen him use his magic at all. Mirago dropped out of school later when he discovered that he would be forced to learn how to use his magic in his classes and began being homeschooled by his father. After a month of this, Mirago decided to get a breath of fresh air and go for his first walk through the forest since the incident.

    Mirago knew his dad and sister began to worry for him. They were both being supportive of Mirago's magic use and insisted that no one wished him ill after what happened, but he never responded and never showed any signs of having any interest in magic. Mirago had never told them about his promise to never use magic again, and for as long as he could, he intended to keep it a secret. He didn't want his dad to feel sorry for him, or his sister to feel responsible.

    Chapter 2 (108 - 123)
    Chapter 2: Meeting Xaeyz

    During his walk through the woods, he had seen the trees that he had scorched and sped up his walking pace to pass it faster. Just then, he heard a strong whoosh bristle through the leaves, which was odd since there was no wind at all a moment before. He decided to investigate the sound. After a few minutes of walking toward the origin of the wind (which was getting stronger and stronger as he got closer) and soon found himself in a field surrounded by trees with a waterfall that cascaded into a river and over a cliff into the ocean hundreds of feet below. And in the center of the field was another argen boy, using wind magic.

    The two boys didn't move for a few seconds, just staring at each other. The boy walks over to Mirago to which he explains how he got here and hurriedly apologizes, throwing his arms up in defense. The boy, however, noticed that something was wrong and asked if Mirago was okay. Mirago didn't understand this at first until he realised he had started crying. So he told the boy everything: who he was, what he'd done and about his magic. The boy listened intently and after he finished retelling he stated a simple response: 'Then they know it's not your fault. So why don't you?'

    Hearing this response from a total stranger, Mirago smiled and thanked the boy. He introduced himself and the boy said his name was Xaeyz. Xaeyz helped Mirago up to his feet and showed him around his secret grotto. Xaeyz told Mirago his story, and it turned out they both dropped out of school. It was getting dark at this point, and Mirago had to start heading home, but Xaeyz stopped him and offered him a proposition. If he was interested, Mirago could meet him back here tomorrow to start to learn to love his magic again.

    Mirago didn't know how to respond, so he simply offered a maybe, said goodbye, and returned home. He sat on his bed that night thinking over Xaeyz's proposition. It's not like he didn't want to use his magic again, he was just afraid of hurting people with it. But if Xaeyz could somehow help him control this power any better than he could on his own, then at least trying it out couldn't hurt. Tomorrow, he would go back into the woods to meet up with Xaeyz again and ask for his help with his magic comfortability. Tomorrow was going to be the first step back into magic.

    When Mirago arrived the next day, Xaeyz was already there training, throwing wind blasts in ever direction. When Xaeyz turned to see Mirago, his face shifted into a smile and greeted him. Xaeyz said that since Mirago was only afraid of hurting people with his magic, all he needed to do was learn to trust it again by learning to control it better. Xaeyz couldn't help him control his magic since he didn't know how fire magic felt, but he would be here to help stop anything that could go wrong; that and mental support. Over the next three months, Mirago began to slowly overcome his fears.

    Mirago and Xaeyz continued to train together for another two years, sparring which each other and learning new spells. They became each other's rivals, striving to apply to St. Guardia's Academy and become guardians. One day when they were sparring, a tragedy brought itself onto Meteora: a large black meteor hurling towards the town. It shook the ground as it made its descent. Mirago and Xaeyz looked at each other and knew what they had to do: they rushed back to the village to do what they could to stop it.

    Chapter 3 (126 - 137)
    Chapter 3: A Final Stand

    When they got to the village, Mirago and Xaeyz saw the defender argens running away, too. They had tried to stop it, and had no effect on it whatsoever. They couldn't stop it so they were running away. Xaeyz and Mirago didn't know what do. If the village defenders couldn't stop this thing, how could two seven year olds? But something changed Mirago's mind: among them was Mirago's dad. He was running away, too. Mirago immediately jumped down into the fray and towards the meteor. Xaeyz tried to stop him, but followed him in. As they stood and stared at the meteor, they readied attacks to fire at it.

    In the woods, Xaeyz and Mirago had practiced their teamwork and combination spells. They learned that if Mirago used his flames and Xaeyz used his wind, he could amplify the power of the fire. So they launched everything they had at the meteor. However, nothing happened; the meteor wasn't slowing down. Just then, something had begun surrounding Xaeyz; a glistering light swirling around him. Xaeyz opened his eyes and forced more energy than he ever had out of himself. Instead of his greenish-blue gusts of wind, it came out in blues and purples. It looked like an aurora.

    This power engulfs Mirago's flames and amplifies them to a degree that wasn't comparable to their boosts before. With this new power, Mirago decided to put in everything, too. He poured more and more energy into his flames, making them burn hotter and hotter. This new power that Xaeyz had acquired was doing the trick; the meteor was finally slowing down! But Mirago knew that something was wrong. This much power should be slowing it down far more than it was. In fact, the defenders earlier should have had some effect on it. Was the meteor nullifying, no, absorbing their magics?

    Mirago notices himself growing weaker and weaker the more he puts his energy into his flames, but he has just enough strength to help Xaeyz lower the meteor safely to the ground. Afterward, Mirago collapses to the ground in a daze. He knows that he doesn't have long until his magic burns out, so he tells Xaeyz what he discovers. He asks Xaeyz to seal away the meteor before anyone else realizes what it can do, and gives him what is left of his magic to cast his final spell: a Divine Seal that could lock away the power of the meteor for only Xaeyz's use. After sealing this in a rune, Mirago begins his sleep.

    End of Chapter 3

    Chapter 4 (140 - 155)
    Chapter 4: Rebirth & The *Sundrop Valley*

    'Get up.' A black ember ignites itself in Mirago's body and continues to burn hotter and hotter. The power grows and emerges as a large burst, pushing away the dirt prison around him and throwing him out of his grave. Where was he? He tries to open his eyes, but a scar over his right eye forces it closed. He uses his left eye to look around his surroundings and immediately identifies where he is: Xaeyz's Hideaway. Xaeyz must have brought him here and buried him, but why? He seems to have forgotten everything. Mirago walks back to Meteora to find Xaeyz. But seeing the meteor in the center of town brings back everything. He rushes back to the grotto searching for Xaeyz.

    Mirago screams out for Xaeyz, but he's nowhere to be found. Tears well in his eyes and he crumples to the floor in a scream of agony, and releases his black flames, which touch the cut on his right eye. He winces in pain and covers his eyes. But when he releases the eye, he finds he can open it a small amount. His fire must have helped cauterize his eye. He quickly covers his eye with his hand and throws flames into the cut. He screams in pain, but after the pain passes, he's able to open his eye fully. Mirago realized something just then: Xaeyz and everyone he knew thought that he was dead. He was not.

    But that wasn't everything. He was white now. His sapphire glimmering scales now shine a bright white. But that didn't make any sense - argens couldn't have white scales. He walked over to the pond and hesitantly gazed into the water, looking at his new complexion. His eyes weren't lying to him. He really was a white argen now. Not only that, his sclera were a deep black, and his corneas fiery red. What was happening to him? He didn't look anything like himself anymore!

    Mirago turned back to the grave and filled in the hole as best he could so Xaeyz wouldn't know he was alive. Soon after, Mirago met the spirit of the black flames who called himself 'Arc'. Arc explains that his magic is called Onyx Fire, and that he was its sole user. Mirago asked why he only appeared now, and he responded with he only needed to see him now since he lived in his subconscious. Arc said that if he didn't want to use his flames, he had his own and that if he ever wanted to talk again to simply come and see him. Mirago was left confused at his words. He had his own fire? Wasn't Onyx Fire his flames? After a few minutes, he finally got it. Arc was saying he could use normal fire, too.

    Mirago didn't understand how to use the normal fire, though; he'd never done it before. Arc seemed to know how to teach him to use normal fire. Maybe he knew why his scales and eyes looked so different, too. Finding Arc was difficult at first. Where would he even start to look? Eventually, he just started meditating, clearing his head, and that's when Arc first appeared. Arc told him it was because Mirago had died of magic overexertion trying to stop the Black Sun, and Arc used magic to continue his body's functions. Arc advised that his magic would feel different than onyx flames, and that he should try to put his own feelings and strength into it. It took a week or two, but Mirago had finally found a way to reliably use his own fire. It was the most connected he'd ever felt to his magic since using it. Mirago decided that he would train himself instead of going to St. Guardia's with Xaeyz.

    Mirago didn't have a way to seal away the meteor without the rune he and Xaeyz had made and didn't want to risk Xaeyz coming back and seeing him, so he knew he had to leave to keep himself a secret. So he did. He left the grotto for northern Mu'karr under the cover of the forests that grew all over the continent. Ever since then, he's been training his magic in *Sundrop Valley*, honing his skills wth Arc, and waiting for the perfect moment to re-emerge. . .

Yggdrasil Backstory

    Chapter 1 (160 - 179)
    Chapter 1: A Time for Firsts & Lasts

    Yggdra had always been fascinated by magic. Her mother was once a guardian who had retired to live a more quiet and peaceful life. Frinrir, her older brother and who Yggdra called Frinny, was finishing up his final year at St. Guardia's Academy. Frinrir was Yggdra's idol. He was the main reason she was so excited to find out if she had magic. On her fifth birthday, she unlocked her magic and discovered her affinity for wind, just like her brother.

    She was ecstatic, and wanted to show her brother when he came home a few days later. She was too eager about using her magic, however. She had just unlocked it; her control wasn't near average yet. Despite this, one day she practiced near a neighbor's house and her mana lost control and broke their window. When Yggdra's mom found out about it, she forbade her use of magic for a month, which means she wouldn't be able to show Frinrir her new magic.

    Yggdra begged for her to rescind the ban, but her mother wouldn't budge. She had plenty of schoolwork to catch up on, so practicing her magic wasn't the most efficient use of her time, either. But of course this meant nothing to a five year old girl with new magical abilities. The very next day, Yggdra left the house telling her mom that she was going to study with her friend Kiyo. However, what she was really doing was meeting up with Kiyo to practice some more of her magic.

    Kiyo didn't understand why she was still using her magic even when her mom told her it wasn't allowed, and Yggdra said that it was because magic waits for no one. She only wanted to get better at magic as fast as possible, and the first step to doing that was using lightfoot spells. Lightfoot spells were hard for beginners, and especially difficult for beginners who didn't have teachers guiding them through it. But after an argument with Kiyo saying she should stop and stomping the floor, Yggdra had accidentally figured it out.

    Kiyo knew where this was going as soon as Yggdra fell over from the force of her spell, and told her not to do anything drastic. But Yggdra was past that. She gathered all the mana she could into her feet and jumped. The jump launched her a hundred feet in the air, and the sight was unlike anything she had ever seen before. She could see the above the trees of the forest a mile away from her, the town a few miles behind her house, and a great, clear view of the sky. She was awestruck.

    But what she didn't expect to see was smoke billowing out of Kytegrove Forest. Something was clearly wrong; Yggdra could feel it, and she knew she had to tell someone. But she had a bigger problem on her hands: she was falling out of the sky. Thankfully, Kiyo was there to catch her before she hit the ground. Yggdra explained frantically to Kiyo what she saw, and they both returned to Yggdra's house  to tell the one person they knew could do something: Frinrir.

    When they got to the house, a girl was in the living room with Yggdra's parents and Frinrir. The girl's name was Alexis, and was apparently Frinrir's friend from Guardia's and his assigned partner. Yggdra told Frinrir what she saw (and brushed off her mom when she asked how she knew), but it turns out Alexis was here to take him to go and investigate it. Frinrir was going to leave again, and he'd just come home. She hadn't even shown him her new magic yet.

    Yggdra then turned to Alexis and asked her why she had to take him away. Alexis apologised and promised to get him back as soon as possible. Yggdra didn't want him to go, but Frinrir told her it was just a quick job. He'd come home after a few hours and after that, she could show him her new magic. This put Yggdra at ease, and Frinrir and Alexis took off towards Kytegrove Forest. Yggdra waited for a while with Kiyo and played tag for a bit. That's when she felt something horribly wrong.

    End of Chapter 1

    Chapter 2 (182 - 195)
    Chapter 2: A Goodbye

    Yggdra and Kiyo were outside throwing a ball around in Yggdra's yard when she got the feeling. A burning feeling of dread and pain washed over her, and she was paralyzed in place. Something was wrong with Frinrir. She could feel it. At this point, Kiyo had noticed Yggdra's paralysis and was frantically trying to bring her back. Seconds later, Yggdra awoke, told Kiyo what she felt and where she was going, and ran off towards the forest to Frinrir.

    When Yggdra finally reached the forest, she ran through the trees to where she was being led by her vision. There, leaning on a tree, exhausted, lay Frinrir with a hole blasted in his chest. Yggdra froze as tears began to stream down her face. By this point, Frinrir noticed Yggdra's presence, and his eyes widened. He begged Yggdra weakly to get out of here, and that it was dangerous to stay here. Yggdra couldn't hear him though; all she could ask was how she could help him.

    This continued for about a minute until Alexis was blasted by her and landed hard against the tree, knocking her out. This was the thing that finally got Yggdra's attention, and she began to turn around in fear, and looked at whatever was attacking her brother. What she saw didn't stick with her, but what she felt did: a cold, fierce, murderous, uncontrollable force was looming over her. This feeling is what Yggdra would remember and how she would shape the monstrous feeling.

    The thing poised for attack, reaching its hand out to grab Yggdra's head. Yggdra didn't move; she couldn't move. She was petrified by the thing's aura and blood lust. She accepted the fact, then and there, that she was going to die. Just then, she felt a hand on her shoulder, and the thing went flying backwards. Yggdra looked up to see Frinrir standing arm outstretched with magic emanating from his hand. He created a ball of magic and threw it at a stone that the attacker had dropped, shattering it.

    Just as suddenly as he stood up, he fell to the ground. Yggdra lifted him up, begging for him to be ok, but he only managed to say one thing: 'As long as you are alive, I'll be there to protect you. So don't worry.'. After saying this, the light left his eyes, and his body went limp. Within a week of him being a guardian, Frinrir lost his life. Yggdra lost all emotion in that moment. She couldn't move and sat still, tears streaming from her eyes, staring at her brother.

    Chapter 3 (198 - 209)
    Chapter 3: A Darkened Mind

    Alexis woke up a few hours later and saw Yggdra and Frinrir. Of course, she was crushed by the news, but as a guardian and friend of Frinrir's, her job was to protect Yggdra. But when she reached out to her to ask her to follow her out of the forest, Yggdra swatted her hand away. She turned toward Alexis slowly and showed her her lightless eyes before getting up and walking back to her house. Alexis couldn't do anything but follow her.

    Kiyo was waiting back at Yggdra's house with her mom for Yggdra to come back. Of course, when Mrs. Aensyll found out about Yggdra using her magic, she was angry. But all of that fizzled out the minute Yggdra stepped into the door. She didn't say a word, looked down at the floor, and walked past everyone to her room upstairs. No one understood until a bit later when Alexis came in the door and dropped the news. Yggdra's parents were crushed, and Kiyo ran up to Yggdra's room to talk. Her door was already locked.

    Kiyo knocked on the door, asking Yggdra to open the door and that he only wanted to talk. She murmured something that Kiyo couldn't hear. When he asked again, a thundering voice that could only be the result of Yggdra enhancing her volume with wind magic screamed 'NO!' shook the entire house. Kiyo faltered backwards a bit, said that he could talk anytime she wanted and to let him know, and went home heavy hearted from the encounter. Yggdra didn't speak to anyone for quite a while after that.

    Yggdra cursed her own lack of strength as a result of Frinrir's death. She, as a result, began to hate magic as a concept and chose to never use hers for the rest of her life. She couldn't leave her room, so she dropped out of school to try and deal with her own feelings. One day, she had the dream of showing her brother her magic. The next day, she had the dream of seeing him again. All she had left of him now was his guardian jacket, tattered and torn from his final battle.

    Chapter 4 (212 - 225)
    Chapter 4: New Dreams

    Yggdra spent the next four years in her room thinking about what to do with herself. She took a long time to get over the death, and even more time to get herself out of the mindset it had put her in. When she turned nine, she finally asked for Kiyo to come over, wanting to talk and apologise for shutting him out for so long. When he got there, he scooped her up into a hug and thanked the divines over and over that she was okay. They spend the next few days catching up.

    Kiyo helped Yggdra get over her hatred of magic and decide that she was going to go to St. Guardia's to become a guardian like Frinrir was. She wanted to become strong enough that no one would ever have to go through the pain she did. Yggdra had, of course, missed many years of coursework and topics so she was very behind in school. Thankfully, Kiyo was willing to tutor her in whatever she missed. Yggdra never fully understood all of the topics, but she had an idea of them.

    Eventually, Yggdra had to start practicing her magic again, but she was essentially starting from scratch since she hadn't used it in so long. At first, she didn't like using it; it reminded her too much of Frinrir. But she pushed through it and after a few weeks ended up finding magic fun again. From the age of eleven, Yggdra practiced her magic and making it her own in preparation for the Guardia's Entrance Exam. When she was old enough, she went to Grand Elise to take the exam.

    On her way to the exam, Yggdra met her first friend, Cid, and they took the exam together. Yggdra found the written portion of the exam easy, and fought her way to victory in the physical as well.

    A month later, her acceptance letter came in the mail, and from there, the rest is history...

Ryner Khabunago

    Chapter 1 (230 - 245)
    Chapter 1: The Point of the Quill

    Ryner was always a special Khabunago from the day he he manifested. He had inherited the trademark magic of the clan: Shadow Magic and began manifesting it from the very young age of 7, only 2 years after his base magic, lightning, had been manifested. The Khabunago clan was the pinnacle of the spirits in Phalmasia, and the only family that could use Shadow, one of the four lost magics. Those who had the ability to wield the shadows were known as Keepers, and were given the responsibility of watching over the graveyards of Phalmasia, driving away any who wish to disturb the dead.

    Though very young, Ryner trained day after day to build up his strength. Practicing lightning magic along with honing his shadow magic, he soon became far stronger than any spirit his age. Eventually, he was able to manifest a physical body in the form of a fox terrian. He was soon granted a graveyard to keep watch over; a small one in Dullus, Nohla at the age of 12. Many of the resident Majuu were very respectful of the deceased, and only came to the graveyard to pay their respects to lost loved ones or to keep Ryner company.

    One of the young majuu, a silvery furred girl named Quill, came by one day to speak with her recently deceased mother. Ryner, not wanting to disturb something so private, watched nearby in his spirit form. Quill, however, was able to notice him. Taking note of a spirit without their interference was nearly impossible. No one had ever noticed him as a spirit, so this took Ryner aback as he appeared in his fox form to talk to her. Quill and Ryner became friends very closely afterwards, as Ryner helped Quinn come to terms with her mother's passing. When Quinn turned 14, she started taking the entry exams at Eklyptil's university, though it took her three times to pass since she didn't have any magic affinities.

    Once she passed her entry exams and had gotten accepted, she had to leave Dullus to live on campus, which meant Ryner couldn't see her anymore. Just before Quill left for Mt. Moonlight, she hugged Ryner one last time and gave him a kiss, expressing her feelings. She promised to come back every break she could to catch up, and Ryner promised to wait for her there. She gave him a pendant she had made: a lightning bolt and quill inside of a yin-yang orb before she left to remember her by, and left to pack her bags. For her first two years, they did just that. But eventually, Quill stopped coming back to Dullus, and Ryner didn't see her for another two years.

    Soon, the head Khabunagos, a group of the most wise and ancient spirits with shadow affinities, recognized Ryner's great work of keeping his graveyard safe, and had issued a promotion to guard Nabuga's Garden, the largest and most important graveyard in all of Phalmasia, and the highest honor a keeper could receive. But Ryner was hesitant to accept. If he chose to guard Nabuga's Garden, he would have to go to Halgeis, which would mean he'd never see Quill again. But he knew that Quill would want him to accept, lest he put his soul in her hands at the cost of his happiness, so he did.

    Before Ryner left Dullus for Halgeis, he wrote a note for Quill explaining where he had gone. However, when he left to put the note on her mother's grave, the only place he could think to leave it where she would see it, he wondered if he should. Quinn hadn't come back for years. What if she had forgotten about him? Shaking off the thought, he placed the note on the ground wrapping it in lightning magic, which would repel any water and keep it in good shape, and left for Nabuga's Garden.

    Chapter 2 (248 - 261)
    Chapter 2: Nabuga's Garden

    Ryner arrived at Nabuga's Garden, and for the first time in his life, he was not the only Khabunago keeping a graveyard. He was, however, the youngest keeper who had ever guarded the garden in all of history. Unlike the graveyard in Dullus, people were constantly coming and going in and out. It wasn't the largest graveyard in the world for nothing, and Ryner had a lot more work than he ever had. But he made friends with many of the other Khabunago keepers, and he began to become attached to the cemetery. Of course, there were points where Ryner had to scare off people looking to deface gravestones and the cemetery, but most of the time, Ryner just peacefully watched over the cemetery, and that was his life for the next six years.

    The reason that Nabuga's Garden was the most important cemetery in the world was because of the people who were placed to rest there. Some of the strongest magic users who ever lived were buried there, as well as the past royalty of Halgeis. Heroes from across Phalmasia, martyrs and inventors, would be buried in Nabuga's Garden. The magic users, if they had one while they were alive, would be buried with their pacts or artifacts both to pay respect to them as well as to seal them away. This made it a target for those who wanted that power, and why the strongest Khabunagos were stationed there.

    On his 27th Epoch (a birthday to spirits), he went his favorite spot in the entire cemetery: a small hill with a large cherry blossom tree on it to watch the sunset. During a Khabunago's Epoch, it is customary for them to remain in their spirit forms throughout the day to pay respects to their original form. Which is why it surprised him when a voice called out his name from behind. It couldn't be another Keeper, they knew not to disturb someone on their Epoch. But when he turned to see who could have seen him, he stood in shock. It was Quill. Much older and taller, as all Majuu usually were, but she was truly here!

    They spent time catching up, and Quill expressed her apologies for not returning back home for so long. Quill was here because after she graduated, she went back to find Ryner, but only found his note instead. She had gotten a job as an arcanarchaeologist, someone who studies the history of magic and its impact on Phalmasia and its history. But because she was new, she wasn't able to ask for a transfer to Halgeis. So she built up experience and asked if she could transfer to a project in Volqu√∂la to study the magma in the volcano five years later, which got accepted. She had a lot of work to do before she was able to come visit him, but she finally found the time.

    Once midnight had passed, Ryner entered his human form and they kissed underneath the Sakura tree, and they spoke throughout the rest of the night, until Quill fell asleep on Ryner's lap. Ryner had everything he wanted: a keeper of Nabuga's Garden, magical prowess that nearly topped every other keeper there, and a lifelong friend and lover had finally returned to him after so many years. The next two months of his life were absolute bliss. But only those next two months. For two months later and for the first time in history, the Keepers would face a war to protect Nabuga's Garden.

    End of Chapter 2

    Chapter 3 (264 - 285)
    Chapter 3: A Spirit Once Shared

    Quill came to Nabuga's Garden six weeks later, frantically searching for Ryner. Eventually, she found him sparring with the other Khabunagos just outside the cemetery. She had received a new project from her bosses: after her research in Volqu√∂la was completed, she was to lead a group of 5 other arcanarchaeologists to study the soil composition of the ground near those buried in Nabuga's Garden. It would involve them desecrating several grave sites, and in some extreme cases, disturbing the bodies. She had, of course, tried to fight this, but the higher-ups didn't care to listen. She reminded them about the Keepers standing guard the Gardens, but they said that they would fight them off if it came to that. After hearing that, she quit on the spot.

    The other Khabunagos retched in disgust at the thought of someone willingly disturbing the dead at this scale for information. Ryner said nothing, clenching his fist into a tight ball, drawing a stream of silvery blood from his corporeal fox form. He thanked her for doing what she did for the cemetery, but said she had to go. They would stand to listen to her in their offices, but out in the field, they would take more extreme measures. She couldn't be at the gates when they got here, or they might take more than her job. Though Quill tried to fight it, she eventually agreed.

    Throughout the next three weeks, the keepers prepared for the assault on Nabuga's Garden. Ryner set traps across the entrance of the graveyard using his shadow and lightning magic. With all of their preparations, they were sure they were ready. But when the other arcanarchaeologists arrived, there were far more than the five they were expecting. Tens of terrians wielding fire affinities showed up, a vital weakness to the Khabunagos, as shadow magic would essentially be off the table. Ryner told the entourage that they were trespassing on sacred ground, and that they needed to leave immediately. None of them backed down, however, saying that they got paid to do a job, and they weren't leaving until it was over.

    Ryner explained that doing this would disturb the graves of the deceased. It wasn't right, and he was sure they knew it. One of them, a bull terrian, the largest Ryner had ever seen, pushed his way to the front. What he said next shook him to his core:

     "Hey, isn't that what that majuu girl said a while ago?"

    Shocked and concerned, he asked them what had happened, and the bull explained that a silver coated majuu girl tried to stop them on their way over here, even trying to get them to stop by force, so they killed her and moved on, laughing at how someone without magic had tried to stop them. Ryner's eyes went wide. A silver coated majuu girl without an affinity. That was Quill. He was sure of it. His mind started spinning, racing with thoughts. He should have known that she would try to stop them. Why wasn't he there to protect her? She didn't even have magic! When he said to not show up here when it was happening, this isn't what he had meant! How could they do this to someone like her? Someone so defenseless? How could they take her from him?!

    Ryner's eyes went dark, as he started kicking up lightning and shadows around him. He couldn't control his emotions at all. So in a very calm and commanding tone, he said two things: that the gang had better start running, and that the other Keepers had better stay out of his way. At that point, tears streaming down his face, and pitch black eyes, Ryner's lightning shifted to a reddish hue, causing the other Khabunagos to back away. One second, he was standing with the other keepers. The next, his arm was through the bull's chest. He had just killed someone. He was all about keeping death and its processes sacred, and yet now, he didn't care. He just wanted revenge. Red lightning surged from his body, electrocuting the bull and atomizing his body in a matter of moments. Ryner turned to face the others, coldness breezing over him.

    "Run."

    Those farthest away from him began to run away, but those closest fell to the ground, clutching their throats, gasping for air. They couldn't breathe. Ryner in a fit of rage, dispatched what must have been 20 of them instantly, and killed the rest of them soon after. After he had taken the last life, he fell to his knees an sobbed, screaming Quill's name into the sky. He would never see her again. The other keepers came to comfort him and questioned him about that red lightning. He didn't know how to answer, but told them that he was leaving Nabuga's Garden. He didn't feel as though the head Khabunagos would approve of the gruesome display of power Ryner had put on and would banish him anyway. So, he left the graveyard, found Quill's body and gave her a proper burial back in Dullus.

    End of Chapter 3

    Chapter 4 (288 - 295)
    Chapter 4: A Soul Twice Broken

    Ryner now had this annoying voice stuck in his head ever since that red lightning appeared back at the Garden, who called itself Nova. He explained what the strange power, Electron Lightning, was and how to use it. Though Ryner wasn't very interested in how to use it. He could use it well enough already. It was just a stronger version of his own lightning magic, with the added bonus of charring the air. For the next few years, Ryner tracked down the remainder of the gang that had taken Quill from him, using Electron Lightning to kill them on sight. Ryner was getting drunk on this new power, but one day he could no longer use it. Nova confronting him, saying he didn't approve how how violently he was using his power, and wouldn't allow him to use it as long as he continued to take lives for the sake of revenge.

    Ryner grew furious at this, screaming at Nova to return his power back to him. Nova countered saying it was never his power to begin with, which Ryner responded with a slap across his face. Ryner, using his spirit form and shadow magic, built a cage in his mind and threw Nova inside. Ryner began siphoning off Nova's power, which Nova tried, but failed, to resist. This distillation of power made the strength of Electron Lightning significantly weaker than before, but its original overwhelming power still made it a powerful threat. Ryner used this weakened magic to defeat the rest of the gang, and began searching for a place where he could hide and train in secret. Soon enough, he settled on *Trudawn Mountain*, a peak with a flat summit he could use as a training grounds, and a place high in Altaria where no one would bother him. Soon after arriving, Ryner began practicing with his new power, growing more and more hatred for Phalmasian lives, killing more and more whenever it so felt his fancy, for years, until the world feared him. Feared his power. As they should. They took everything he loved away. Now, he was just taking his turn.
