    Aurora Scythe: Magic Pact
    | Xaeyz's staff is made of a special meteor that could channel and amplify magical energy. He later learned to channel the energy through the staff more precisely, and formed a dual-bladed scythe; a weapon that represented his combat style perfectly. This scythe became his magic pact.

    Aeon: Spirit of the Stars
    | Aeon is the spirit of Cosmic Wind, and the partner of Xaeyz. The only reason Xaeyz can use Cosmic Wind at all is because Aeon is with him. Similar to the other spirits of the *mythical* elementals, Aeon has no physical form and exists only in Xaeyz's psychal library. This, as a result, gives Xaeyz two active consciences.

By extending his pinky and thumb on his hand, he can create elongated flame structures from his fingertips and bind them with a string made of flame. This allows him to conjure fire arrows and other flame projectiles with his magic and fire them at his enemies. He can give the flames different properties to increase their utility.

    * Terra Sabre: Combat
    * Terra Sabre: Strike Charge
    | Earth Sink

    Terra Sabre: Magic Pact
    | Using his broadsword as a base, Aeiyou can plunge it into the earth to wrap the blade in stone. This makes attacking slower, but he can counter this with more accurate strikes and a far sharper blade. While he uses his pact, he can control his blade without touching it by using magic on the earth on his blade, allowing for both utility and enhanced combat.


    Spells: Ice
    | Freeze Field
    | Ice Shards
    | Frost Fire
    | Glacier Seal
    | Ice Slide

    Pact Combo: Terra-Frost Sabre
    | Aeiyou had the idea of using the withering effect of Frost Fire in conjunction with his pact. By freezing over his blade, he can cause the same withering effect ice magic has on armor with every hit. Though the cold temperature makes the blade even harder, it also makes it more brittle and susceptible to cracks and damage. This isn't imbuing his pact with ice magic, rather adding it to its base effects, which is why it is still considered his pact after using two magic types in tandem.

    Earth Hammer: Magic Pact
    | Kinto can use his mana to condense the earth into a hammer that he can wield. This hammer carries extreme power, and causes immense damage even without a spell. However, wielding the hammer is incredibly difficult; even for Kinto. Because it is so dense, the hammer is very heavy, and the only way Kinto can use it is to cast his hands and feet in stone as well. This gives him enough power to brace himself while using the weapon and enough strength to swing it.


    Spells: Fire
    | Flame Explosion
    | Ember Shower
    | Fire Emission

    Pact Combo: Hellflame Hammer
    | Because setting his hammer on fire wasn't sustainable, Kinto made an alternative combination. Because the hammer served as an extension of himself (as near all pacts are), he was able to use the hammer in a very unique way. When he slams it on the ground, he can use the point of impact as an ignition of a chain of explosions that combust in a straight line over a short distance. Fire magic is an extremely useful aspect to Kinto; Earth magic has a very short casting range and limited Kinto to close-range combat. Fire magic combats this and gives him ranged capabilities.

    | Terra Dome

    Turcobé's Runebook
    | When he first discovered he had magic at the age of 10, Turcobé's father gave him his old runebook that he used to use when he still used magic. This book allows Turcobé to add his own runes to the pages and use them in tandem with his spells. This doesn't count as a pact, however, since it doesn't require any magic to maintain. Because he specializes in Earth Control, a sort of spell style that requires making earth float, his mana runs out exceptionally quickly. Holding up earth has a high mana cost, and by using runes from his book he can circumvent the mana cost.

    Voltaic Falchion: Magic Pact
    | Ryner uses his lightning magic, as well as his fixation on power, to shape his lightning into a solid, sharpened mass called a falchion. Because of its composition of lightning magic, it has special properties. It is able to phase through defenses as well as perform instant strikes by using lightning magic. He can also section it by cutting the blade and binding it back together with a bolt of lightning. This allows it to act like a whip. By polarizing it with his Raijū Cloak, he can control it from a distance as a boomerang-like weapon, as well as constant rotation for improved offense and defense.
