About Mythical Elements (22 - 29)

    About Mythical Elements
    
    Mythical Elementals are a hidden class of magic that are extremely rare in the world of Phalmasia. They first began manifesting over 600 years ago, with Ryner being the first known user.  This class of magic is unique: it is physically impossible for anyone to use any of these magics. These magics are bestowed upon worthy users by the mythical elementals, spirits that protect different aspects of Phalmasia. They choose a host, and once they do, they are bonded together for life, and gives the host the ability to wield their mythical element. Because of this, at any one time, unlike other classes of magic, only one person can use any given mythical element.
    
    Users of mythical elementals receive a large strength boost with the ancient mana of their mythical element flowing through them. It allows magic they cast to be more concentrated, and as a result, powerful. Xaeyz has referred to this boost as 'Synergy'. Being chosen by a mythical elemental has requirements, many of them differing between the elementals. One rule, however, is steadfast: your first magic must be the same affinity as the mythical elemental. If a mythical element chooses a host with a different base affinity, casting any type of elemental magic, whether it be their base magic or mythical element, will result in an uncontrolled release of the other, in an event Xaeyz has called 'Dissonance'. Because of this Dissonance, it is impossible for one person to be the avatar of more than one mythical elemental. Not only will their elements reject each other, but the strength of the dissonance is amplified in such a way that even without using either of the two the magic power will destroy the user from the inside out, which would eventually lead to their death.
    
    Becoming an avatar for a mythical elemental alters the user's mana. This alteration is responsible for two things: the inherent power boost the user receives and the forceful awakening of the user's dormant magic. All avatars of mythical elementals utilise their base and mythical element, but they also awaken a second magic, though it won't awaken until the user is ready to use it, which could be instantly or a few years depending on the strength and maturity of the user.

Dynamic Water (33 - 44)

    Dynamic Water, the Mythical Element of the Sea
    
    Mythical Spirit Name: Lumen
    Sigil Color Representation: Dark Blue
    Mythical Enhancement: Increased Water Pressure & Healing Factor
    Mythical Beast: Sea Serpent
    Power Event: King Tides
    
    Dynamic Water is the Mythical Element of the Sea, and Lumen is its spirit. Lumen is a serene spirit; she rarely does anything to disturb others and keeps to herself. She spends her time caring for the seas and its life. She ensures that all sea creatures are being treated fairly, and uses her power to stop them from bullying or hurting each other unjustly.
    
    Dynamic Water can heal diseases in the oceanic animals and purify the water from pollution. It can also be used to heal injuries to a greater degree than other mythical elements, but still doesn't hold a candle to the healing abilities of Life. It also has a unique compression factor that makes it possible to compress the water far more than ordinary water, which leads to increased water pressure. This creates a large boost in its destructive capabilities. Dynamic Water also has bioluminescent properties.

Zenith Earth (48 - 59)

    Zenith Earth, the Mythical Element of the Terrain
    
    Mythical Spirit Name: Chrono
    Sigil Color Representation: Dark Gray
    Mythical Enhancement: Increased Earthen Nutrients & Lava Manipulation
    Mythical Beast: Golem
    Power Event: Volcanic Eruptions
    
    Zenith Earth is the Mythical Element of the Terrain, and Chrono is its spirit. Chrono is an extremely determined and trustworthy spirit. He always sticks up for those he cares about, as well as for the health of the terrain. His steadfast nature is perfect for commanding the earth to his bidding, and makes him a reliable friend. Zenith Earth provides a boosted number of nutrients to the plant life in the area, increasing their life force and allowing them to grow faster and into more beautiful plants, acting as a pseudo-nature magic. It is, of course, inferior to the real thing since it cannot manipulate the plants it grows, and cannot grow plants anywhere near as quickly due to only providing nutrients and not direct magic.
    
    However, his main strength lies in the ability to manipulate the phase of the earth he uses, changing it into lava. He can then use this transmuted lava as if it was earth and attack his target with it, making his attacks extremely volatile.

Cosmic Wind (63 - 74)
    
    Cosmic Wind, the Mythical Element of the Stars
    
    Mythical Spirit Name: Aeon
    Sigil Color Representation: Purple
    Mythical Enhancement: Stardust Manipulation & Vacuum Override
    Mythical Beast: Phoenix
    Power Event: Aurora Borealis
    
    Cosmic Wind is the Mythical Element of the Stars, and Aeon is its spirit. Aeon is a free soul and lives on trying to keep everyone around him safe while being as free as possible. He does as he pleases most of the time, but he is also responsible for guiding starlight to Phalmasia, as well as creating constellations. Essentially, he is responsible for all celestia visible from Phalmasia.
    
    Cosmic Wind isn't composed of Phalmasian air; it's the manipulation of Solar Wind & Stardust. This gives cosmic wind control over stardust, which it can use for an assortment of tasks. Stardust can be used for the enhancement of attacks and revitalize the life force of those it chooses, increasing the effected's healing factor. Additionally, because Cosmic Wind is composed of Solar Wind, it has the versatility of being used within a vacuum, or a place with no air, like space. This also gives it the capability of producing artificial auroras by shooting large quantities of magic into the atmosphere.

Onyx Fire (78 - 89)

    Onyx Fire, the Mythical Element of the Sun
    
    Mythical Spirit Name: Arc
    Sigil Color Representation: Pure Black
    Mythical Enhancement: Heat Amplification & Eternal Flames
    Mythical Beast: Dragon
    Power Event: Solar Storms
    
    Onyx Fire is the Mythical Element of the Sun, and Arc is its spirit.  Arc is an ambitious and dedicated soul who tries to keep to those he trusts close and always strives to become stronger with his friends. He is consistently aiming to get better at everything he does and is extremely competitive when with those close to him. Arc is responsible for the maintenance of the sun. He keeps the balance of its intense power from radiating too far from its core and damaging the planets that orbit it (including Phalmasia).
    
    Onyx Fire burns with a dark black flame that has special properties. Unlike other flames, Onyx Fire can be eternal; it can't go out unless the user wants it to. This is because it doesn't depend on air to burn, and it is unaffected by physical interactions, like water or other fire extinguishers. It also has the innate property to burn at a higher temperature than other flames, as well as perfectly control flame temperature even on flames that have already been cast.

Electron Lightning (93 - 106)

    Electron Lightning, the Mythical Element of the Skies
    
    Mythical Spirit Name: Nova
    Sigil Color Representation: Dark Red
    Mythical Enhancement: Electron Destabilization & Silent Thunder
    Mythical Beast: RaijÅ«
    Power Event: Supercell Thunderstorms
    
    Electron Lightning is the Mythical Element of the Skies, and Nova is its spirit. Nova is a rational and precise soul. He thinks about how his actions affect everyone and everything around him, and that makes him a valuable spirit when in times of turmoil. He is also an energetic and excitable spirit who finds interest in magic, which gives him an aptitude of control over Electron Lightning.
    
    Nova is responsible for maintaining the weather. He keeps the weather from becoming too destructive & disruptive to Phalmasia's life and terrain. He is also responsible for maintaining the strength and effectiveness of the atmosphere, as well as preventing its degradation.
    
    Electron Lightning has the ability of electron destabilization. This lightning is compressed so thin that the temperature increases far higher than that of normal lightning. This, instead of compressing the surrounding air, destabilizes the electrons of air and burns them. This creates a section of unbreathable air around the impact area. As a result of not compressing but burning the air, the lightning does not create a thunder sound, causing silent attacks until the moment of impact.

Permafrost Ice (110 - 121)

    Permafrost Ice, the Mythical Element of the Moon
    
    Mythical Spirit Name: Cryo
    Sigil Color Representation: Light Purple
    Mythical Enhancement: Dry Ice & Contact Freeze
    Mythical Beast: Kitsune
    Power Event: Whiteouts
    
    Permafrost Ice is the Mythical Element of the Moon, and Cryo is its spirit. Cryo is a closeted soul, choosing to keep to herself for the most part. She is also extremely organized and likes to keep her surroundings clean. Cryo is responsible for the maintenance of the moon. She is responsible for ensuring that the orbit of the moon is steady and continuous, and that it doesn't interfere with the sunlight often.
    
    Permafrost Ice is unlike normal ice in composition which is composed of frozen water; it is frozen carbon dioxide. Because it is a gas, as it is released it creates shrouds of the gas around it as the ice melts. This also allows for it to freeze at much lower temperatures than normal ice: absolute zero. Permafrost Ice also has the innate ability to contact freeze. This means that if any amount of Permafrost Ice comes into contact with water, it freezes it starting from the point of contact of the Permafrost Ice.

Mythical Beasts (125 - 134)

	Mythical Beast Manifestation
		Mythical Tier Spell
	
	| Spell Style: Mode/Utility
	| Mastery: Extreme
	
	A unique type of magic manipulation only capable by mythical element users. The process of doing this is something that only the mythical elemental know, and the casting of which something only their users can handle due to their increased mana capacities and higher skill ceilings. The spell revolves around summoning the spirit of the mythical element's mythical beast around the user, giving the user the abilities of the beast, additional magical power, and specialized spells only usable in the beast form.
	
	This spell has two forms. One is where the user transforms into a hybrid being, keeping their size but gaining magic appendages that resemble their mythical beasts, like wings, tails, and horns. The other is when the user transforms completely into their beast, constructing the body of their own mana and controlling them from within with their hybrid form. Both forms increase magic utility and damage to an incredible degree, making it an extremely useful part of any mythical elemental user's arsenal.

Rebirth (138 - 149)

	Rebirth
		Mythical Tier Spell
	
	| Spell Style: Conditional/Medicinal
	| Mastery: Impossible
	
	Rebirth is an extremely powerful spell that no one but the mythical elementals themselves can cast. Being a conditional spell, there are several requirements that must be met before activation. The mythical elemental must be bonded to a living user for over a year, and the user must be on the brink of death or have died less than 10 minutes prior. If the spell is not cast during this time, the spell will fail. The mythical elemental must also want to revive their user, meaning that the user cannot cast this spell on themselves, both because they physically couldn't while on the brink of death, and the user requires consent from their elemental before the spell can be casted at all. Once Rebirth is casted, the end effect is that the previously vitally harmed host will return to a perfectly healthy state.
	
	This works by the mythical elemental using their own mana to pump energy through the host. This essentially means that the user now has mana running through their veins instead of blood, and their energy becomes more potent as a result. Their magic skyrockets in power upon waking up from rebirth, as well as changing the color of their fur, skin or scales (depending on the race of the mythical element user) to a pure white, pitch-black sclera, and well as giving their eyes the color of their primary magic.
	
	The drawbacks to this technique are severe, however. By using their power to keep their user alive, the mythical elemental is significantly weakened by the endeavor, causing the user to be unable to call upon the force of their mythical element as strongly as they could before. Because of the body's new reliance on mana, the user is also extremely vulnerable to shadow attacks, as temporarily shutting off their mana results in the user entering a severely weakened state similar to death.
