Lost Magic Overview (3 - 10)

    Lost magic is a class of magic that is seen very rarely in some special individuals. Lost magics may have prerequisites, like being part of a certain bloodline or race. These magics, unlike elemental magics, can only be learned as a second magic. Many of these magics are far more powerful as a result, and are far less researched than their elemental counterparts due to their rarity. This results in an overall lower proficiency level for users of lost magic, and it is thought that the full extent of any given lost affinity has not yet been achieved by anyone in history.

Shadow Magic (14 - 28)

    Shadow, the Element of Reflection
    Sigil Color Representation: Black
    Passive Ability: Creating shadow copies. The mana cost increases with the number of clones.
    
    Shadow is a magic that only the Khabunago Family is capable of; a family of spirits that use Sprite Pacts to gain mortal & physical forms. They are the spiritual protectors of graveyards, guarding them from any who wish to disturb the graves of those who are buried there. Shadow magic allows the user to create and manipulate darkness. It is possible to create solid shadows using this magic, which can be used to cause extreme damage. Many classify this as a dark magic, and can be easily dispelled with fire magic.
    
    Basic Spells:
    | Cloak Spells: The caster hides their physical body in a nearby shadow, increasing their movement speed and travel capabilities. They are able to be damaged while in their shadow by attacking the shadow directly. The less mana you have remaining, the slower you move, and the more you are pushed out of the shadow.
    | Tendril Spells: The caster shapes the surrounding shadows into solid spike-like structures that can grab or damage opponents. The more proficient the caster, the more range and damage they can deal.
    | Dark Mana: The caster forms projectiles from the surrounding shadows and throws them at the target. It can also be used to lock the shadows of the target in place, restraining their movement. This, however, is an active ability, and no other spells can be cast while restraining a target. The stronger the caster, the longer the stun, and the stronger the projectile.
    | Banish Spells: The caster concentrates the shadows of the target to strangle themselves, cutting off the target's flow of mana and preventing them from casting spells for a short time.

Nature Magic (32 - 44)

    Nature, the Element of Harvest
    Sigil Color Representation: Dark Green
    Passive Ability: Immunity to non-magic based poison & paralysis from plants.
    
    Nature is a magic that works similarly to Earth; the only difference is it utilizes the plants instead of the ground itself. It can cause plants to grow at and extremely quick pace, as well as change their capabilities by making them poisonous. All poison created by a user's spells do not affect the caster. This also allows the user to create and manipulate wood, which creates strong and versatile defenses. This magic has an advantage against wind magic.
    
    Basic Spells:
    | Nurture Spells: The caster channels mana into wildlife around them and increases their growth speed. It is the core of nature magic and the basis of all its spells, as it also gives the caster control of all plants in the area. The more proficient the caster, the faster the rate of growth becomes, and the more precise the control gets.
    | Vine Spells: The user grows vines that can emerge from anywhere on the battlefield within the caster's reach. They are used to attack and grab targets. The stronger the caster, the faster and longer the vines can become.
    | Property Spells: The caster concentrates mana into the surrounding plants and changes their properties, allowing them to emit spores with effects of the caster's choice. The larger the plant, the larger the mana cost.
    
    Notable Users: None

Life Magic (48 - 62)

    Life, the Element of Sacrifice
    Sigil Color Representation: Green
    Passive Ability: Natural healing factor is enhanced.
    
    Of all magic, Life is the most risky and dangerous to use. It uses a visible stream of life energy to cast and use spells. Life magic can also heal targets, but at a high cost to the user.
    
    Basic Spells:
    | Give & Take Spells: The caster channels a stream of life that takes from one thing to give to another. This can be used to transfer resources from one place to another, like water or nutrients. If the caster takes something from one thing or person, it loses said status and the receiving end gains said status.
    | Sacrifice Spells: A sub-genre of Give & Take Spells that specifically deals with human injury and basic healing. This revolves around the caster taking injuries from one target and giving them to another. This results in the healing of the initial target and the injury of the post target, and requires both party's consent to work.
    | Absorb Spells: The caster wraps their hand in a mana stream that draws all mana-based attacks towards it and absorbs them. This replenishes the caster's mana supply proportional to the amount of mana the target used to cast the spell.
    | Mirror Spells: The caster surrounds both arms with streams of mana. This absorbs a mana-based spell targeted at the caster with one hand, then releases the spell through the opposite arm. This, however, takes mana, and the caster must expend mana equal to the amount of mana used to cast the original spell.

Gravity Magic (66 - 80)

    Gravity, the Element of Control
    Sigil Color Representation: Gray
    Passive Ability: A psychic-like ability that allows the user to lift and manipulate objects with their mana.
    
    Gravity magic is the rarest of all magics. It can only be used by Argenian families who live in the mountainous regions of Mu'karr. Using this magic makes the controlling mana invisible to both the user and those around them, as well as the largest attack radius of all magics. It controls gravity in a spherical radius around the target of the spells, and works as a psychic ability would. Gravity can be used to move objects to the will of the user. However, due to its rarity, those who have it usually don't know how to control it. The user can choose whether the gravity they manipulate affects them or not.
    
    Basic Spells:
    | Barrier Spells: The user emits an arc radius towards the casting direction. This makes any target that enters that radius shoot towards the ground, physical or mana based, before it can deal damage to the caster. Though it has never been a recorded attempt, it may be possible to increase gravity to a degree that a magic-based spell that enters the barrier is immediately dispelled.
    | Impulse Spells: The caster compresses their mana into a sphere and sends it at a target location. On either command or impact, the sphere disperses, releasing a powerful impulse that forcefully pushes everything in the sphere's radius away from the center of the sphere.
    | Push Spells: A melee based spell. The user concentrates mana in their palm and strikes the target. This causes a blow that deals devastating damage and sends the target flying backward. This can also be used to create shockwaves when striking the air.
