Magic types are classified by their rarity, and each magic affinity is vastly different from any of the others.

    There is one additional magic classification that can only be accessed by those who are strong enough to wield them. Hints have been littered throughout the database. May the stars guide your way.

Fire Magic (29 - 45)

    Fire, the Element of Ambition
    Sigil Color Representation: Red
    Passive Ability: Resistance to non-magic flames & heat

    Fire magic is a magic geared more towards offense, and the only magic that continue to grow without the caster's maintenance or mana. This also makes the magic difficult to control for new fire users. This magic is commonly associated with the caster's emotions, since it sometimes grows in power in accordance to them. Fire users are known to be determined, motivated, or obnoxious when accomplishing their goals.

    Basic Spells:
    | Ember Palm: The user covers their hands, and occasionally arms, in fire magic. This both adds extra power in close-range fights, and allows for basic ranged attacks.
    | Burst Step Spells: The user covers their feet, and occasionally legs, in fire magic. This both adds extra power in close-range fights. Additionally, it can be used to concentrate mana under the user's feet and create an explosion that boosts their jump height.
    | Combustion Spells: A ranged application of fire magic that allows the user to concentrate their mana at a distance and cause an explosion.

Water Magic (49 - 63)

    Water, the Element of Flow
    Sigil Color Representation: Blue
    Passive Ability: Using mana to walk on water

    Water magic is a magic geared towards defense. Using this magic takes tact and planning. Users of water magic are able to alter the temperature of water by freezing and boiling it. Users of water magic are known to be relaxed and in tune with their surroundings, and are passive about their thoughts and opinions.

    Basic Spells:
    | Breath Spells: The user takes a large breath to increase their lung capacity so they can stay underwater for longer periods of time. They do this by surrounding their heads with an air bubble. The stronger the caster of the spell, the larger the air bubble is, and the more people can fit in it.
    | Glow Spells: This type of spell can only be used when the user's hands are covered in water. The caster uses mana to make the water around their hands glow to illuminate dark underwater areas. The brightness and proximity of the glow is determined by the caster's strength.
    | Moisture Spells: This spell is the basis of water magic. Users can't create their own element like many of the other magics, and aren't around it at all times, either. This spell allows them to take water from the air and plants in the surroundings to use.

    Notable Users:
    | Mimi Seiran
    | Amiru Soaren

Lightning Magic (67 - 80)

    Lightning, the Element of Precision
    Sigil Color Representation: Yellow
    Passive Ability: Short distance teleportation

    Lightning is a magic that specializes in quick, precise attacks. If dealt with enough power, these attacks may inflict extra shock damage or even temporary paralysis. Due to the concentration of lightning magic, it can easily be used to penetrate a target's armor. Though the magic's overall power isn't substantial, it more than makes up for it in speed. Users of lighting magic are known to be excitable and confident.

    Basic Spells:
    | Shock Step: The caster releases lightning from their feet, allowing for increased movement speed. High level casters will leave trails behind them as they move, which cause added shock damage and possible paralysis.
    | Dart Spells: The caster releases a quick bolt from their hands, dealing damage and possibly stunning the target.

    Notable Users:
    | Cidelli Reimora
    | Ryner Khabunago

Wind Magic (84 - 99)

    Wind, the Element of Free Paths
    Sigil Color Representation: Teal
    Passive Ability: Slight flight & Gliding

    Wind, when used in high concentrations, can be used to slice objects or opponents at high speeds. Defensively, however, it must deflect most magic attacks and projectiles. This magic is preferred by those who use speed and agility in their combat. Using their magic, they are also able to use streams of wind to push and pull objects from a distance. Users of wind magic are known to be lone wolves who travel their own path and fight for what they think is right.

    Basic Spells:
    | Lightfoot Spells: The caster channels mana into their feet which allows them to increase their speed and jump height, cushion their landings, and, along with the help of a glider, glide and even fly for a short period of time.
    | Breath Spells: The caster gathers mana in their lungs to increase their lung capacity to blow out winds of high speeds, increase their volume, and hold their breath for a prolonged period of time. The more experienced the caster, the more air can be brought into the lungs.
    | Sharp Spells: The caster presses mana together to create a sharp blade of wind with which they can throw as a projectile or attach to their body as a sword-like extension. The size, speed, and cutting power of these blasts are dependent on the strength of the caster.

    Notable Users:
    | Xaeyz Kai
    | Yggdrasil Aensyll
    | Yumeizu Artilux

Ice Magic (103 - 115)

    Ice, the Element of Resistance
    Sigil Color Representation: Light Blue
    Passive Ability: Resistance to non-magic based freezing temperatures.

    Ice is a powerful magic for both offensive and defensive capabilities. This magic is extremely deadly to even the user at times, so using it with a pact for better control is highly recommended. This magic has the capability to penetrate a target's armor, but not with the level of proficiency of lightning. They can freeze the air, water or ground around them, which allows for an increased range of mobility on the battlefield and place-locking opponents. It is also the only magic with no distinguishing base shape, coming out in spikes if used in brute force.

    Basic Spells:
    | Frost Fire: The user conjures a freezing flame that shocks armor, withering it away and making it easier to penetrate. This can cause serious damage if use directly on a person's vitals with extreme intensity.
    | Spike Bullet: The user creates multiple ice spikes that float behind the user's back until they call for them to be fired. These can be shaped into any object, but spikes are most commonly used as they deal a lot of piercing damage. The speed, durability, and size of these projectiles scale with the user's strength.

    Notable Users:

Earth Magic (119 - 134)

    Earth, the Element of Nature
    Sigil Color Representation: Brown
    Passive Ability: Hardened resistance to magic based attacks.

    Earth is a magic that is both offensive and defensive. Earth magic relies on the ground beneath the user's feet, giving them free reign to control the battlefield at will. Being such a sturdy magic, earth can easily use their defense as offense and vice versa. Due to this, it has a lot of ways to counter other elements. Though earth magic uses the most magic energy to cast spells of all other elemental magics as well as the shortest casting range, its combat capability more than makes up for it. This magic is preferred by those who fight up close.

    Basic Spells:
    | Earth's Step: The user impacts the ground, creating a crack and sending a wave of earth in the direction of their target. It is a good move to narrow the opponent's line of sight, as well as throw them off their balance.The stronger the caster, the larger the wave.
    | Pillar Spells: The user creates pillars of earth from the ground, striking opponents or use as a defense. They can also be ripped from the ground and float in midair for a while. The stronger the caster is, the larger the pillars will be, and the faster they can create them.
    | Soft Sand Spells: The caster concentrates their mana on a certain area on the ground and softens it, creating a quicksand-like pit. This sinks the target down as far as their torso, and extremely strong casters can sink opponents down to their shoulders. It is impossible to use this spell to sink someone completely.

    Notable Users:
    | Aeiyou Drefael
    | Kinto Vareli
    | Turcobé Sentai
