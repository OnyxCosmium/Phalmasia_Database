Xhia Overview (3 - 11)

    Xhia is the smallest of the four continents, hosting a dry, barren terrain. The grass and trees of the forests that once covered the northern part of Xhia are now gone due to the Arduos War, leaving half of the continent in a dry grass, treeless wasteland. Though, despite all this, the southern half of Xhia retained its natural beauty. Mu'karr is known for its fast forests, but Xhia was known for its plethora of flora species, and in southern Xhia, these plants still grow and are cared for. The main residents of the continent, the Majuu, are a serene and peaceful race, caring for nature and protecting it as best they can. The capital of Xhia, Clorohfyll, is in the burned northern section, making it void of all of its pre-war beauty. However, despite the newfound lack of flora, the city itself is still a beautiful place to live.

Puls, Xhia (15 - 23)

    Puls, Xhia

    Primary Resident Race: Majuu
    Pronunciation: PULSE
    Location: Northeastern Xhia
    Visitor Friendly: No

    Puls is a town in the burned section of Xhia. It doesn't have many residents. Because of the poor soil quality, plant life isn't that big of a factor in the town, besides a few trees that help add color. The town has been trying to replace the soil in their town to start replanting the flora that once covered their town. Before the Arduos War, this town used to be home to a magic school. But after seeing what the war did to both their reputation and the rest of the world, they decided to close the school and have the students learn magic from experimentation on their own. While they do not forbid the use of magic throughout the town, it doesn't have a school for teaching magic any longer. Residents are expected to either figure it out for themselves, or have their parents teach them.

Glouden, Xhia (27 - 40)

    Glouden, Xhia

    Primary Resident Race: Majuu
    Pronunciation: GLOW-den
    Location: Southern Xhia
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | Luminous Vineyard
    | True South Pole

    Glouden is in Southern Xhia, so it wasn't affected by the great fire, and because of this, the plants that are natural to the Xhia region are still able to grow there. The central-southern region of Xhia is particularly dark and cold as a result of being at the bottom of the southern-most continent in Phalmasia. However, this special climate allows for unique types of plants to grow, particularly bulbroot vines, a type of vine that grows glowing pods and flowers. This rare type of bioluminescence covers the trees and rocky terrain of the village, and makes the town and surrounding flora much more welcoming and serene.

    There is a small forest behind the town covered in bulbroot, which the townspeople call the Luminous Vineyard. The True South Pole of Phalmasia is located in the Luminous Vineyard, and the residents of Glouden have placed a marker in the ground where it lies. This is one of the few towns that welcome visitors from outside of Xhia, feeling as though this beauty shouldn't be restricted to the eyes of only the Majuu, though some still avoid the region altogether because of stigmas.

Clorohfyll, Xhia (44 - 56)

    Clorohfyll, Xhia

    Primary Resident Race: Majuu
    Pronunciation: CLO-ruh-fill
    Location: Northern Xhia
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | St. Guardia's Academy

    Clorohfyll is the capital of Xhia. Being in the northern half of the continent, it's been torched by the embers of the war, draining the city of region exclusive flora, and of much of the natural beauty it once had. Though it bears a mark of embers, its residents haven't lost their spark of hope and friendliness. They still openly welcome non-majuu visitors, and are trying to restore the forest and lush plant life surrounding their city. They have rebuilt over half the city after the fire, which leads to a contrast between ancient architecture and the new, modern-age designs. This makes it a popular place to learn about architecture and construction in Xhia, as well as across Phalmasia.

    Clorohfyll got its name from the several different species of flora it had throughout the city, but after the great fire, it has since lost its significance. Clorohfyll is also one of the only places in Xhia where combat can still be instructed. They have a St. Guardia's Academy of their own, where many Majuu apply to every year, hoping to get in. Because of the fact that it is one of the only schools in the region that can teach combat, many more students apply every year, resulting in the highest application rates of any St. Guardia's Academy, and a far lower acceptance rate. However, this also leads to high dropout rates, since many of those applying don't intend to become guardians and simply want magic or combat training.

Mengoro, Xhia (60 - 70)

    Mengoro, Xhia

    Primary Resident Race: Majuu
    Pronunciation: men-GO-row
    Location: Western Xhia
    Visitor Friendly: No
    Sub-Locations:
    | Echo's Chasm

    Mengoro is a small village on the western outskirts of Xhia. It was one of the southernmost cities to be affected by the fire, but thanks to the fast-acting earth magic users, the town and its surroundings were saved. The result was a chasm that arched across the northern and western borders which became known as Echo's Chasm. Many residents in this village are guardians or retired guardians, which is why there were enough proficient earth magic users to stop the flame's progression. However, because of the high volume of guardians, many don't wish to travel to Mengoro, so it remains somewhat isolated. Majuu from across the region have given it the name 'Guardian's Cove' due to the Echo's Chasm, which separates the guardians in the town from the other towns in Xhia.

Zenorah, Xhia (74 - 89)

    Zenorah, Xhia

    Primary Resident Race: Majuu
    Pronunciation: zen-OH-rah
    Location: Southeastern Xhia
    Visitor Friendly: No
    Sub-Locations:
    | Austreal Crown
    | Sunlight Pond: Yang
    Town Trade:
    | Weaponry

    Zenorah is a village on the southeastern coast of Xhia. The core of the city is the Austreal Crown, where a large amount of natural magical energy is concentrated. The majuu harness the immense source of energy in the crown to create extremely powerful weapons which they provide to the other continents. Many from outside Xhia did not want the Majuu to have complete autonomy around the Austreal Crown because of bias and fear that they might use these weapons to start another war, but it was decided to have the majuu watch over the crown by the leaders of the continents. This shows trust to the majuu by giving them space to continue their lives, as well as leaves them in charge of managing magic flow in the crown.

    At the center of the Austreal Crown, much like the Boreal Crown in Entrype, is Sunlight Pond: Yang. This pond, unlike the yin half in Altaria, bears a dot that resembles a flaring sun. The pond water has been imbued with the excess amount of natural energy and has healing properties that the Majuu use. It cannot be used outside of Zenorah, however; if the water is to leave the village, it would lose its energy concentration and return to being normal water.
