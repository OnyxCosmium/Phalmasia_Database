Nohla Overview (3 - 13)

    Nohla is unique compared to other continents, because it is composed of large islands, each of which are home to all of the five races of the world. Because of the diversity of the continent, there isn't a official leader over everything, as residents think that would put one race above the other, something they strive to avoid. Because the people here are so kind and welcoming to everyone, it makes it a great place for people to visit and live in. Surrounded by ocean in all directions, Nohla is Phalmasia's largest seafood and ocean product exporters. Many original residents here usually originate from other continents and immigrate here.

Korfu, Nohla (17 - 29)

    Korfu, Nohla

    Primary Resident Race: Terrian
    Pronunciation: CORE-foo
    Location: Western Nohla
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | Tropics Grove

    Korfu is a short island on the western side of Nohla that lies close to sea level. This means that it is naturally surrounded by beaches, and has a very tropical climate. The seawater is also very clear near the shores, and many resorts line the beaches as travel locations to tourists and visiting people. Because of the summer-like climate and resorts, Korfu has become one of the most popular islands people visit when coming to Nohla.

    Korfu also houses Tropics Grove, a tropical valley that has several pine trees and bushes growing different tropical fruit, like pyreapples and cocomelons. Tropics Grove is open to the public on weekends, and a farmer's market is opened every Saturday. Tropics Grove also allows Korfu to export large amounts of fruit to the other islands of the continent, which gives it a steady source of income.Korfu is big on protecting its environment, so the island takes many steps to prevent it's deterioration.

Hartledge, Nohla (33 - 46)

    Hartledge, Nohla

    Primary Resident Race: Argen
    Pronunciation: HEART-ledge
    Location: Northern Nohla
    Visitor Friendly: No
    Sub-Locations:
    | Hornscale Caves
    | Whispering Forest

    Hartledge is an island covered in trees similar to Mu'karr, which is why its population mainly consists of argens. Most of these argens, however, are archaeologists and proficient scholars in history and magic. This is because Hartledge hosts the Hornscale Caves, one of the oldest recorded cave systems in Phalmasia. Not much is known about the caves, however the walls give off a strange magical signature that is difficult to notice, but seems to have been there since its inception thousands of years ago. The caves go deep into the heart of the islands, and the researchers believe that discovering the secrets of the caves may lead to a deeper understanding of magic as a whole.

    Due to the caves being actively under research, the island isn't open for visitation. However, the Whispering Forest can be seen from other nearby islands of Nohla, as their pink leaves and silver trunks are very vibrant. The island is high enough that there is a breeze constantly flowing throughout the forest, and the trunks of these hardened sakura trees whistle in the wind, which is why the forest has been dubbed the 'Whispering Forest'.

Eklyptil, Nohla (50 - 68)

    Eklyptil, Nohla

    Primary Resident Race: None (Balanced)
    Pronunciation: eh-KLIP-til
    Location: Central Nohla
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | St. Guardia's Academy
    | Twilight Mall
    | Starrgem River

    Eklyptil is the capital of Nohla, and the only island to be made up of more than one island: Solaro and Lunaro, connected by sky bridges built at intervals throughout the islands. The two islands resemble the sun and a crescent moon, hence the name of the islands. The islands are aligned such that the sun is placed into the curve of the crescent moon, creating a unique island structure. The islands are separated by the Starrgem River. Because it is surrounded by the other islands, it sees very concentrated amounts of moonlight during the night, so the stones at the bottom of the river twinkle brightly causing the river to sparkle, reflecting the night sky. On both Lunaro and Solaro, there are viewing platforms and overhangs for people to sit and watch the river.

    Solaro, Nohla
    Solaro, also known as Dawn Isle, is the sun-shaped island in Eklyptil. St. Guardia's Academy is built on the edge of the island, and takes up almost a third of the island's space. Because of the nature of Nohla, it is the most inclusive branch of St. Guardia's since it doesn't lean towards tailoring its classes to one specific race. This St. Guardia's is built around the edge of the island, and utilizes the cliff side to build additional training ground terrains for students. The island itself has lots of open space and is about 250 feet above sea level, so the weather there is mostly warm, but very comfortable. A winding dirt road spirals the island to give a safe way to get resources and people from arriving ships to and from the city.

    Lunaro, Nohla
    Lunaro, also known as Dusk Isle, is the moon-shaped island in Eklyptil. It is the home of Twilight Mall, the biggest mall in the continent, and a hotspot for tourists and visitors since it hosts a variety of popular foods, clothing, and activities from different races. This gives visitors a true eye into other race's cultures and customs. It's also a fun day trip because it has several indoor activities, like an indoor theme park and movie theater. Bridges span across the Starrgem River to Solaro, and a dirt path also spans across the inner curve of the moon to sea level. It is much longer than the one in Solaro, however, due to Lunaro being closer to 550 feet above sea level.

Dullus, Nohla (72 - 82)

    Dullus, Nohla

    Primary Resident Race: Majuu
    Pronunciation: DULL-loos
    Location: Southwestern Nohla
    Visitor Friendly: Yes

    Dullus is a small island separated from the rest of Nohla. Though it is still part of the continent, the island isn't part of the group of islands that make up the rest of Nohla. The populace is mostly made up of majuu who have been thrown from their homes in Xhia due to their crimes against their fellow majuu during The Arduos War, as well as those who couldn't find their place in the world after leaving Xhia because of prejudice. These majuu have grown kind due ot their time together, and are very friendly towards outsiders who happen to visit their island. However, due to who inhabits the island, many are afraid to go to Dullus, and have avoided it altogether.

    Though the island doesn't import or export anything, the majuu are able to sustain themselves through livestock and agriculture. Since they are so far from the rest of Nohla, they used what little land they had to build themselves a natural paradise. However, the population of Dullus drops nearly every generation since the younger majuu often choose to leave for the mainland of Nohla or another continent altogether. Because of this, the majuu have made a plan to be reliant on nature, up to the point where if they all left, then the island would easily be reclaimed by nature.

Cingrigh, Nohla (86 - 103)

    Cingrigh, Nohla

    Primary Resident Race: Majuu
    Pronunciation: CIN-gree
    Location: Northeastern Nohla
    Visitor Friendly: Yes

    Town Trade:
    | Weapons
    | Armor
    Sub-Locations:
    | Magmatic Cavern
      * Hellheat Forge

    Cingrigh is a mountainous island with a deep magmatic cavern in the center. This, in addition to Nohla's tropical location, causes the climate to be extremely hot nearly all the time. Majuu who originate from warmer climates and therefore have lighter fur colors are more suited to live here. The island itself isn't entirely hot, though, as the mountaintops are quite cool since they are so high up. However, because of its altitude and low amounts of oxygen, only avats make their homes that high up. Visitors to Cingrigh unless a majuu or have a fire magic affinity must wear a form or heat resistance in order to prevent overheating.

    Inside the magmatic cavern lies the Hellheat Forge, the largest forge in all of Phalmasia that's outside of Xhia. The natural flow of lava throughout the cavern makes the weapons able to be forged and quenched at much higher temperature differences, causing weapons and armor with increased durability. This forge, however, is completely inaccessible to anyone but heat-resistant majuu with fire affinities because of the insane temperatures within the forge. Only the best blacksmiths may use it to prevent any fatal accidents, which serves to increase the average quality of anything leaving the forge as well.

    Talen, Nohla

    Primary Resident Race: Avats
    Pronunciation: TAL-en
    Location: Eastern Nohla
    Visitor Friendly: Yes

    Sub-Locations:
    | Eagle's Beach
    | Skyward Tower

    Talen is a flat island that somewhat resembles the talon of an eagle. The island rests at sea level, and constantly has a cool sea breeze blowing across its landscape. The resident avats love this because many of them have wind affinities that make them feel more in tune with their magic. However, avats to generally like to live in high places, and so they have build a tall tower on the tip of the island's talon. At the top of the tower, there is a small grassy park that many avats with flyers license jump off of it and glide down for a rush. Since the island is at sea level, it is surrounded by a beach. The beach has naturally white sand because Talen makes an effort to keep the beach clean. Eagle's Beach, as it is called, and the Skyward Tower attract many tourists to Talen to spend time at the beautiful beaches and admire the continent from above.

Skyhaven, Nohla (123 - 131)

    Skyhaven, Nohla

    Primary Resident Race: Human
    Pronunciation: SKY-hay-ven
    Location: Southeastern Nohla
    Visitor Friendly: Yes

    Skyhaven is the highest island in Nohla, but despite this, mostly humans made their homes here. Despite not having magic and thereby not having any natural resistances to the cold weather, they have made do by building heavily insulated homes and having heat crystals littered throughout the town, being careful not to have too many in one place in case they melted the snow to cause avalanches. Humans here are commonly scientists and astronomers since they are closer to the stars than anywhere else in Nohla. People who visit Skyhaven who don't have wind affinities usually need an air pack because of the lack of oxygen due to the height. Being so close to the stars makes for a beautiful view of the night sky, and visitors commonly gather on the undeveloped edge of the island where light pollution is lowest to view space.
