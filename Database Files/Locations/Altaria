Altaria Overview (3 - 13)

    Altaria is a lone island continent that is mostly mountainous terrain with lush cliffs and deep caves. Many of the mountains exceed cloud height, which means that many inhabitants of Altaria, the Avats, live very high up. As a result, many of them learned wind magic to assist in their breathing. Because of the many high peaks of the continent, the views from the cities of Altaria are breathtaking, which attracts many tourists. The natural terrain is mostly rocky and steep which makes natural trees very rare, so Avats import saplings that can handle their climate from Mu'karr. Because of the steep terrain, many villages in Mu'karr are built with different architecture that brings stability on vertical surfaces, like the steep mountainside. Manafield, the capital city of Altaria, demonstrates this architecture since it has buildings built up and improved over the history of the continent. This adds a unique aesthetic that can't be found anywhere else in the world.

Entrype, Altaria (17 - 33)

    Entrype, Altaria

    Primary Resident Race: Avat
    Pronunciation: EN-tripe
    Location: Northern Altaria
    Visitor Friendly: No
    Town Trade: Technology & Research
    Sub-Locations:
    | Boreal Crown
    | Moonlight Pond: Yin
    Town Trade:
    | Mana-based Technology

    Entrype is the northern pole of Phalmasia, called the Boreal Crown, and the northernmost town of Altaria. The Boreal Crown, being a pole of Phalmasia, has a concentrated amount of natural magical energy. The Altarian guardians send those at the top of their class in combat skill to guard the crown, as many who desire the natural mana will try to use it for their own needs. The natural mana is only allowed to be used by the researchers of Altaria to enhance magical capabilities and effects.

    At the center of the Boreal Crown is Moonlight Pond: Yin. It is a pond shaped as the yin half of the yin-yang, but the dot is an island shaped of a crescent moon. The water in this pond has special properties due to it being at the center of the Boreal Crown and is used in the avat's research. Though the highlight of the town is the Boreal Crown, Avats do live outside the pole. Because of the icy climate and flat terrain, many homes are igloos insulated with mana from the crown, and others are mountain homes in the cliffs of nearby mountains. Though visitation is limited due to the crown's presence, Entrype is still a beautiful village to live in.

Soraikai, Altaria (37 - 49)

    Soraikai, Altaria

    Primary Resident Race: Avat
    Pronunciation: soar-EYE-KYE
    Location: Western Altaria
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Town Trade:
    | Altaria Mail Service (AMS)

    Soraikai is a mountaintop village that rests just below cloud level. Most every resident here has wind magic to assist in their breathing, as the height of the city doesn't provide much air. Buildings are outfitted with wind magic-based tech that increased air amounts in the building. The terrain of the town primarily consists of a plateau where some of the town sits, and the mountainside homes that are built into and onto the mountain walls surrounding the plateau.

    The town is high enough off of the ground that at some points, it is actually difficult to see the ground below. But, at the lowest sections of the town, there are places that residents or visitors can observe the ground down below. People who visit must be outfitted with an air tank at all times unless they are proficient wind users for their own safety. Somme come to savor the view of the world from up above, while others drop by for skydiving, as the height of the village makes for an ideal starting point. It is also the reason that Soraikai hosts Altaria's Mail Service (AMS); since mail deliverers have such a high starting point, they can use wind magic to glide to other towns without using much mana to gain altitude.

Cerulaine, Altaria (53 - 63)

    Cerulaine, Altaria

    Primary Resident Race: Avat
    Pronunciation: SER-oo-lane
    Location: Northeastern Altaria
    Visitor Friendly: Yes

    Cerulaine is the only city in Altaria that is primarily at sea level. Because of this, residents share a distribution of magic affinities of wind, water, and ice. This also gives the town the freedom to use architecture that is more common outside of Altaria. The houses can be larger than others in Altaria, and can be more flat than normal as well. This is primarily a city-town though, and many of the buildings are tall for both residential and business needs.

    Because the height isn't so high, it has a normal amount of oxygen. This makes the city more feasible and comfortable for tourists since they don't need to carry around air just to walk around the town while still getting a good taste of the Altarian experience. This fact makes it one of the most popular tourist towns of Altaria, second only to Manafield. It is also popular due to the aquatic surroundings of the city. Because it is so close to the ocean, it has the ability to host water-based events and activities, which also adds to the tourist attraction of the city.

Luminour, Altaria (67 - 79)

    Luminour, Altaria

    Primary Resident Race: Avat
    Pronunciation: LOOM-in-or
    Location: Eastern Altaria
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | True North Pole

    Luminour is another mountain city that is in a very special place in terms of its location. Though Entrype hosts the Boreal Crown, it doesn't host the True North Pole. The crowns of Phalmasia only host the magnetic poles of the planet, but the True North Poles are in a separate location that is in reference to the terrain. Because it is on the True North Pole, it is one of the few towns in Altaria that goes through the Yin Night & Yang Day, a process in which the sun appears to stay up for half the year, and sets for the other half.

    Because of the uniqueness of the location and the Yin & Yang Day & Night cycle, many people travel to Luminour to experience the strange sun patterns. This actually ended up giving the town its name; Luminour. 'Lumi' is based on the word 'Luminous' which means bright while 'Nour' is based on 'Noir' which means black. The residents are used to the months of night and months of day at a time, and have based their entire way of doing things on it. Because it is so hard to tell the time simply by looking at where the sun is in the sky, they have a bell tower that rings on the hour. They are also a big research town since the natural light hours are so constant.

Keravine, Altaria (83 - 95)

    Keravine, Altaria

    Primary Resident Race: Avat
    Pronunciation: CARE-ah-veen
    Location: Northwestern Altaria
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | Mountain's Green

    Keravine is a mountain city like many others. However, it is special in the fact that it is surrounded by a forest named 'Mountain's Green'. Natural trees are rare in Altaria, so to have a forest surrounding the city is extremely rare. Of course, due to the altitude of Keravine, normal trees cannot survive, so the trees that grow there are trees that can't grow anywhere outside of Altaria.

    The trees have much lighter and larger leaves than normal to allow for increased carbon dioxide sunlight intake. They also grow vines that grow beautiful flowers, making the usual stony mountain scenery very vibrant and open. Some species of birds only live in these trees, whether it be because of the height, the colors, or the unique sap the tree produces. All of these natural elements liven up the area and make it a popular place for Avats to live and for people to visit.

Thornhaven, Altaria (99 - 112)

    Thornhaven, Altaria

    Primary Resident Race: Avat
    Pronunciation: THORN-hay-ven
    Location: Central Altaria
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Town Trade: Fresh Produce
    Sub-Locations:
    | Cascade Gardens

    Thornhaven is a town in the center of Altaria. It is in a valley in between two mountains and is one of the few towns that has flat area within its borders. However, unlike other towns that use the area to build on, nearly no buildings are built on the flat ground. Thornhaven uses this space to grow and maintain the Cascade Gardens, a plot of land that maintains different types of plant life.

    Though this is open to the public, there are some plots that are for private use only. These are used by scientists and researchers who are studying plants to gather information about them that could be used for medicine or nutrition. This is one of the most intuitive and progressive research gardens in all of Phalmasia, as well as a beautiful location for visitors to see. The gardens also help support Thornhaven by growing fruits and vegetables that the locals are able to help grow and pick for themselves.

Manafield, Altaria (116 - 130)

    Manafield, Altaria

    Primary Resident Race: Avat
    Pronunciation: Mah-nah-field
    Location: Southern Altaria
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | Port of New Worlds
    | St. Guardia's Academy
    | 9th Cloud

    Manafield is the capital city of Altaria, and is the largest city in all of Altaria by a wide margin, and in the world. It spans over the entire southern mountain region of Altaria, and covers over 20 mountain bases. At the southernmost point of Altaria, a port was built to interact with the mainland of Phalmasia more easily, and was called the Port of New Worlds. Most of Altaria's international imports and exports come through this port and are then distributed to other cities in the continent.

    It also has the largest mall in Phalmasia called the 9th Cloud. It has many different activities and shops that the citizens of Manafield commonly use. Finally, being the capital of Altaria, it holds the Altarian branch of St. Guardia's Academy. The academy is on the west side of the city and isn't surrounded by other buildings. This is because the school needs a training ground for the students to practice on. This is also a unique branch as it is the only one built on a mountainside. Because of the large size of Manafield, the amount of land that Altaria's St. Guardia's has is far greater than those of the other branches.
