    Mythic Location: Aurora Grotto, Mu'karr

    Location: Southeastern Mu'karr
    Visitor Friendly: N/A
    Mythic Elemental: Aeon

    "It's strange, being from the stars. Everyone down here looks so odd, so weak, so different. You think that after living with one of them for years I would have gotten used to the sight of them. I guess I just never expected to see anyone but those two here. I don't know how you got here or why you know of this place, but welcome, traveller, to Aurora Grotto. Don't give me a reason to make you leave." - Aeon, Spirit of the Cosmic Wind

    Aurora Grotto is a special location that only Xaeyz and Mirago know of. This is a grotto in the vast forests of Mu'karr near the sea. It is extremely serene, with waterfalls running into a lake with an island that Xaeyz and Mirago seem to have built a bridge to out of a fallen tree.

    There are several fruit trees lining the grotto, and a cliff on the edge of the grotto hosts a beautiful view of the sea. Xaeyz and Mirago met each other in this grotto, and trained here nearly every day for two years before Mirago passed. It is also the location of Mirago's grave, which rests under the tree on the island in the lake.

    The most important part of the grotto is the clear skies overhead. The grotto actually experiences a higher rate of natural auroras that last longer than the average. This makes it the ideal location for Xaeyz to train and relax due to the boost that the auroras give to his Cosmic Wind.

    Sundrop Valley, Mu'karr (21 - 35)
    Mythic Location: Sundrop Valley, Mu'karr

    Location: Northwestern Mu'karr
    Visitor Friendly: N/A
    Mythic Elemental: Arc
    Enhanced Natural Event: Solar Storm

    "The sun is such a simple place. Just elements fusing with each other to extend the system's life. It's beautiful, in a way; the ultimate precipice of teamwork. But this world is different. People fight each other, steal from each other, hurt each other, kill each other. But even in this world of wrong, there are still shining lights. Atoms that still want to work together for the betterment of the system. I don't know how you know of this place's existence, but welcome nonetheless. I hope that you're a good atom, or we are going to have a bit of a problem." - Arc, Spirit of the Onyx Fire

    Sundrop Valley is a special location that Mirago alone discovered and knows of. It lies in the Cryonili Mountain range in a deep valley between the mountains. In this valley, there is a vast lake with an island in the center. There is also a decently large field in the valley, which Mirago uses to train. When Onyx Fire revived Mirago, he left Xaeyz's Grotto and went out to find a new secret place where he could be alone. In his search, he found this valley.

    The valley is deep enough that the surrounding mountains actually provide decent shelter against the outside weather, so the valley is warm and naturally climate controlled. Being surrounded by mountains and undiscovered by people, the terrain is completely preserved from interaction and has retained its natural beauty. It is also closed off from the outside world, providing a peaceful and private environment for Mirago to train freely.

    This valley, to Mirago's great surprise and pleasure, also rests above a natural small hole in the planet's atmosphere. This allows radiation from the sun to burst through in higher quantities, mimicking the properties of a solar storm during times of intense violence on the sun's surface. This happens to be Mirago's power event, and makes his Onyx Fire stronger.
