Halgeis Overview (3 - 19)

    Halgeis is the first, and currently only, continent where humans inhabit. Terrians are the primary inhabitants of Halgeis, and are also the ones in power in the continent. The humans and the terrians came together in piece relatively quickly, but the argens, avats and majuu weren't so trustworthy. To help along their relations, the terrians and humans constructed the city capital, Grand Elise, the peace capital of the world. With time, all of the races now reside in Grand Elise, and though relations are not perfect, they are still in place.

It has a deep cavern down the side that runs around the northern and eastern side of the town facing towards Mu'karr called Voltoru Cavern, which hosts a calm and steady flow of magma into the volcano's chamber.

It hosts many skilled blacksmiths, and it is among some of the main providers of armor and weaponry in Halgeis, which makes it relatively respected in the country. However, most of the villagers prefer to keep to themselves and their community, so the town doesn't get many visitors.

    Notable Residents:
    | Yggdrasil Aensyll

    Ashford is a peaceful town on the northern side of Halgeis. The town itself is larger than other common villages in Halgeis because of the regions of Kytegrove Forest it covers, as well as many nearby open fields. The townspeople are very close-knit and mostly all the residents knows each other, and because of this the residents are very supportive and welcoming to others in the community and outsiders stopping by. Those born with magical capabilities venture to the open fields to spar with one another or find a peaceful, open place to train in solidarity. The town doesn't have any landmarks or produce any products they trade commonly, so Ashford is mostly a quiet settling place for terrians to live a peaceful life with their families.

    Notable Residents: Kimiko Quintai

    Skykumo is a mountainside village so high that it is near cloud height, which is how the town got its name. It is on Tengou Mountain, one of the tallest mountains in Halgeis. It is a village of avats, since only they can breathe clearly in such thin air. Despite avat's natural acceptance of all people, Skykumo is rather closed to visitors. It isn't the fact that avats do not welcome visitors, it is that many visitors simply do not come to Skykumo.

    It is a simple town with the only attraction being its height and its proximity to the clouds. Most don't come to see this, however, because the thin air in Skykumo makes breathing extremely labor-intensive and is dangerous to most without protective gear or wind magic.

Grand Elise became the symbol of peace in the world, and the first official result of progression towards interracial acceptance. After St. Guardia's Academy was destroyed during the Arduos War, they decided to rebuild it in the center of Grand Elise.

    Location: Western Halgeis
    Visitor Friendly: No
    Sub-Locations:
    | Enchanted Forest

    Drəklife is a small village on the easternmost side of the Enchanted Forest. It has a small population, but the town acts more as a family than a village; everyone is close-knit, and though visitors are welcomed with open arms, many are unaware of its presence and don't stop by. Because of its seclusion, it is one of the few towns unprotected by a guardian post, which leaves it open to the attack from wrongdoers. But because it is so secluded, they rarely get attacked anyway. Drəklife harvests most of its resources from the nearby Enchanted Forest, but is still respectful enough to replant any trees it cuts down. Their work has done almost nothing to the health of the forest, but their care has actually improved it. Those who live in Drəklife have learned to care for the environment and others.

Piquaron, Halgeis (218 - 228)

    Primary Resident Race: Avat

    Location: Southwestern Halgeis
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Notable Residents:
    | Turcobé Sentai

    Piquaron is a small village in Halgeis inhabited by avats. There are few avat towns that are built at ground level, and Piquaron is one of those few. Piquaron is an average town that takes great pride in its village's magic ability. Usually, avats are born with ice or wind magics suitable for their usual home heights, but because of the low altitude, most avats here actually have a greater affinity for earth magic than ice.

    Magic affinity is taken very seriously, and all citizens here view magic as an extension of themselves, giving them faster mana regeneration and larger mana reserves than most. Piquaron schools teach students in a rather unconventional way; instead of teaching them spells, they teach them mana control. This not only leaves the students to figure out spells on their own which increases their understanding of their magic, but it also teaches them to find ways to use them more efficiently and in a way that is comfortable for them.
