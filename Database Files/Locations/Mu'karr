Mu'karr Overview (3 - 15)

    Mu'karr is the continent that rests in between Xhia and Halgeis. Mostly consisting of forests and mountains, Mu'karr is a natural continent that residents strive to preserve. The main race of Mu'karr are the Argens, a dragon-like species. They built their cities around the forests instead of cutting them down, leaving most of the large cities of Mu'karr with unusual houses, like those in tree trunks or caves. Forécyør, the first established city of Mu'karr, became the center of the continent and spurred its growth. Argens are extremely friendly towards most outsiders and other races, so many towns in Mu'karr are visitor-friendly. It is also home to the high majority of bioluminescent plant life that Phalmasia has to offer. The result is Mu'karr looking like something out of a fairy tale, which helps draw in tourists looking to gaze in the natural beauty of the continent.

    Mu'karr has two hidden locations that can only be accessed by those who know their name. Hints have been littered throughout the database. May the stars show you the way.

Trefaeli, Mu'karr (19 - 31)

    Trefaeli, Mu'karr

    Primary Resident Race: Argen
    Pronunciation: tree-FAIL-ee
    Location: Southwestern Mu'karr
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Town Trade:
    | Clothing

    Trefaeli is a peaceful village in Southeastern Mu'karr. Due to the hilly terrain of the city, the trees aren't able to grow their roots completely underground, and many burst through to the surface. This causes the trees to grow strangely sideways, creating many archways of trees throughout the town. This adds a natural beauty to the village.

    Though there isn't much to do here, it is a producer of high-quality argenian clothing, though it isn't a major producer. They do sell their products to all of Mu'karr, but due to the size of Trefaeli, they can't afford to create high supplies.

Andromita, Mu'karr (35 - 45)

    Andromita, Mu'karr

    Primary Resident Race: Argen
    Pronunciation: an-DROM-ita
    Location: Western Mu'karr
    Visitor Friendly: Yes

    Andromita is one of the few villages in Mu'karr that is in a clearing with very little forestry. Though forests do surround the clearing, there are minimal trees in the town itself. This leaves Andromita as one of the few towns with fully constructed houses that aren't integrated into the forest.

    Argens who live here wish to lead a quiet life; most find enjoyment in small activities like gardening or collecting. Magic is rarely used in this town for combat since most people agree to keep the town friendly. Since the town is very small (the population is around 400 due to the small size of the grove), guardians don't need to have a post in the town, and it rarely ever receives any problems. It is a nice place to visit, even if you are just passing through.

Dragolyne, Mu'karr (49 - 61)

    Dragolyne, Mu'karr

    Pronunciation: DRA-go-line

    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | St. Guardia's Academy

    Dragolyne is one of the largest cities in Mu'karr. It is an integration of both forestry and mountainous regions of Mu'karr, so the buildings and architecture throughout the town are varied depending on which region they reside in, adding a unique mix of personality into the town. This makes it a good place for visitors to want to come and learn about argenian culture.

    This town also hosts the St. Guardia's Academy of Mu'karr, a sister academy of the one in Halgeis. Though they are the same academy, their curriculums are tailored to argens. The school has made Dragolyne a more lively place for residents, visitors, and their incoming students.

Meteora, Mu'karr (65 - 83)

    Meteora, Mu'karr

    Meteora is a peaceful town. The community of the town is very close-knit, and most all residents know each other. This is also Xaeyz and Mirago's hometown. The town is also responsible for hosting the greatest smith-shop in the continent, which was originally run by Xaeyz's grandfather. They are well known throughout all of Mu'karr for their weaponry and armor forging.

    In 4030, the Black Sun emerged from the sky and came crashing towards Meteora, but it was stopped by Xaeyz and Mirago before it made a huge amount of damage. Though the impact of the meteor was cushioned, the Black Sun still caused a large crater in the middle of the town. Many people visit the crater, though the public isn't aware of whether or not the Cosmic Wind User existed or if it was divine intervention until after the Battle of Judgement.

    Forécyør is the capitol city of Mu'karr, and happens to be the largest city in the continent, as well as the first city established in the continent. It is in the middle of the densest part of the forests in Mu'karr. It hosts Dawndew Mall, the main shopping center of the city and of Central Mu'karr. It hosts a large amount of stores, as well as a shipping hub that allows for large shipments of essentials like produce and intercontinental goods.

    The town's houses are built into the several trees in and around the town, which creates a mystical setting in the town around the dirt and stone-paved paths of the city. Many of the trees grow a special type of fungus that produces random bioluminescent colors, lighting up the city nights. It also hosts the continents central library: Eden's Library. This is built into the largest tree in the city, and even continues underground. Residents of Forécyør use the library on a daily basis for a multitude of reasons, and everyone does what they can to preserve the natural beauty of their city.

Dendraiye, Mu'karr (104 - 118)

    Dendraiye, Mu'karr

    Primary Resident Race: Argen
    Pronunciation: DEN-dray
    Location: Northern Mu'karr
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | Cryonili Mountains
    Notable Residents:
    | Sereina Fynae

    Dendraiye is a small town in Northern Mu'karr. It rests directly outside the Cryonili Mountains, the mountain range that spans as a border from Halgeis and Mu'karr. It hosts the safest entrance into the mountains for hikers via a series of magic-made paths over the years. This attracts many adventure-hungry visitors looking to climb the mountains.

    The mountains are very cold, and the weather is extremely volatile. Snowstorms and avalanches roll down the hillside to the town very often, and guardians that have ice affinities are usually stationed there to protect the towns below. Sereina Fynae has made her home deep into these mountains, using the dangerous terrain as a training regimen for her own magic.

Petalford, Mu'karr (122 - 136)

    Petalford, Mu'karr

    Primary Resident Race: Argen
    Pronunciation: PE-tal-ford
    Location: Eastern Mu'karr
    Visitor Friendly: Yes
    Sub-Locations:
    | Fewl Institute
    Town Trade:
    | Produce

    Petalford is a large village in Eastern Mu'karr. It is mostly open fields that the residents use for gardening, primarily fruits and vegetables. While some residents here are farmers, there are still plenty of others who reside here as normal townsfolk with other professions. The fields that are grown here are extremely efficient due to the soil that they have nurtured with magic. They are able to farm very quickly in this soil, producing crops in less than half the time. The argens here have also figured out how to use their wind magic to yield the crops invulnerable to the seasons by keeping the climate standard.

    The argens here are open to visitors, as most all argenian towns are, but they would rather keep to themselves. It is also one of the few villages that has an extremely good magic school. Though it doesn't rival the size or outreach of St. Guardia's, the training that it provides is on par with the school, and many argens who don't get accepted into St. Guardia's choose to apply here instead.
