# Project: Phalmasia
Project: Phalmasia is a database that holds all the information on the world, story, history, and magic function of the
world of Phalmasia. This project will hold different parts of the story and is a project that is completely for my
enjoyment. Updates will be uploaded both as private gists and to this repository.

***Launch Instructions***

*You are going to need to download a compiler that can run python, as well as Git compatibility.* Clone the repository by copying the link given on
the GitHub website (click the green 'Code' prompt on the repo in your browser). Create a new project using VCS and paste
the link. This will allow you to clone the repo and access the code. Be sure to make a branch if you choose to make any 
edits to the code, so you do not affect other user's experience.

If you are a returning viewer, simply pull the most recent versions from Git upon opening your existing project. This
will update your code to the most updated version.

The code is still accessible via gists I will make (though they will be private) with the same methods, but they will only be updated when
an update is completed. In addition, the gist updates will be made available on the repo under the folder 'Archive: 
Database Versions'. This repo is now the most efficient way to keep up-to-date with the database.

***Core Commands***

**Characters:** A Core Command that hosts different main characters' basic information, including names, birthdays, magics,
etc. Depending on the character, they may have backstories detailing their stories before the main story starts.

**Locations:** A Core Command that hosts the four different continents and their most prominent locations. This will include
the locations of hotspots of the listed towns, as well as a description of the continent selected. Some locations may
also have special hidden locations that can only be called by name and don't appear as a prompt.

**Magic:** A Core Command that hosts the different types of magics that exist within Phalmasia. They are separated based on 
their individual rarity: Elemental, Lost, or Mythical. Another section is dedicated to sigil magic, a high-level marking
only available to the most powerful of magic users.

**Races:** A Core Command that hosts information on the different races of Phalmasia: Human, Terrian, Argen, Avat, and
Majuu. This describes special traits about each race, and what magic is available to each one.

**History:** A Core Command that hosts information on the history of the Phalmasian world. It hosts events that helped shape
present-day Phalmasia, as well as caused major shifts for the future of the world. It also hosts the info on the two
time periods of Phalmasia (Before Divine's Gift & Post Divine's Gift) and the difference between them.

Concept of content of this code is from the Webcomic Guardia: Tales of Halgeis by LemonyBeagle. Link to the webcomic can
be found below. Not all story and magic and its systems are kept as lore in this code, as changes were made based on my 
preference of the story, as well as original characters to supplement the original cast.

Thank you for your interest in my project! Please let me know of any suggestions you may have. The Update Log Documentation
is given below so you know what was changed or added in each new or previous update.
