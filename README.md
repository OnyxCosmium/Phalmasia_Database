# Phalmasia Database
Project: Phalmasia is a database that holds all the information on the world, story, history, and magic function of the
world of Phalmasia. This project will hold different parts of the story and is a project that is completely for my
enjoyment. Updates will be uploaded both as private gists and to this repository.

Characters: A Core Command that hosts different main characters' basic information, including names, birthdays, magics,
etc. Depending on the character, they may have backstories detailing their stories before the main story starts.

Locations: A Core Command that hosts the four different continents and their most prominent locations. This will include
the locations of hotspots of the listed towns, as well as a description of the continent selected. Some locations may
also have special hidden locations that can only be called by name and don't appear as a prompt.

Magic: A Core Command that hosts the different types of magics that exist within Phalmasia. They are separated based on 
their individual rarity: Elemental, Lost, or Mythical. Another section is dedicated to sigil magic, a high-level marking
only available to the most powerful of magic users.

Races: A Core Command that hosts information on the different races of Phalmasia: Human, Terrian, Argen, Avat, and
Majuu. This describes special traits about each race, and what magic is available to each one.

History: A Core Command that hosts information on the history of the Phalmasian world. It hosts events that helped shape
present-day Phalmasia, as well as caused major shifts for the future of the world. It also hosts the info on the two
time periods of Phalmasia (Before Divine's Gift & Post Divine's Gift) and the difference between them.

Concept of content of this code is from the Webcomic Guardia: Tales of Halgeis by LemonyBeagle. Link to the webcomic can be found below.
Not all story and magic and its systems are kept as lore in this code, as changes were made based on my preference of the story, as well as
original characters to supplement the original cast.

Thank you for your interest in my project! Please let me know of any suggestions you may have.
